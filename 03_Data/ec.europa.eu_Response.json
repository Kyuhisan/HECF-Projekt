Applicants submit proposals for talent recruitment programmes that will provide researchers holding a doctoral degree with excellent research and academic opportunities, potentially coupled with management activities, to lead them to concrete and attractive career prospects. This will have an impact on the enhancement of human resources in R&amp;I at institutional, regional, national or international level. These programmes will be co-funded by MSCA Choose Europe for Science.</p><p>The programmes will be divided into two phases. A first phase (24-36 months) in which the EU funding is equivalent to the minimum gross salary for the recruited researcher during this phase and a second phase (24 months) in which the applicant is expected to continue to employ the researcher, set salaries attractive at a national level and ensure availability of the necessary internal or external funds.</p><p>Proposed programmes can cover any research disciplines. The selection procedure for candidates must be open, competitive, merit-based and with a transparent international peer-review in line with the European Charter for Researchers<sup>[1]</sup>. Alignment with the principles outlined in the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment<sup>[2]</sup> is also encouraged. Selection criteria should be based primarily on excellence. Additional selection criteria require clear alignment with local human resources needs identified in the relevant institutional, regional or national strategies. These must be described in the proposal and must be listed in the vacancy notice (to be widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS website<sup>[3]</sup>) alongside the gross salaries applicable to the two programme phases (net salary + employee’s taxes and contributions). Selected fellows will be able to work in research, teaching or management positions and, where relevant, define their own research topic at their host institution(s). The programmes should aim at offering excellent working conditions to researchers, including salary, professional resources, and career development.</p><p>The career development should incorporate transversal skills but also job-specific skills and, where relevant, language courses to ensure that the training is in line with the career opportunities offered following the fellowship. These opportunities must include concrete and attractive long-term career prospects, such as pathways towards open-ended contracts, which can be subject to assessment and evaluation. There must be a fair, equal, inclusive, transparent, structured career accession and progression system providing access to these opportunities in line with the Council Recommendation of 18 December 2023 on a European framework to attract and retain research, innovation and entrepreneurial talents in Europe, the European Charter for Researchers in its annex and the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment.</p><p>A Career Development Plan must be maintained throughout the period of the Choose Europe for Science programme. In addition to research objectives, this Plan comprises the researcher's career development needs, including training on languages, transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events. The Plan should outline the projected career progression paths in the host institution.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:C_202301640\">Council Recommendation of 18 December 2023 on a European framework to attract and retain research, innovation and entrepreneurial talents in Europe</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://coara.eu/app/uploads/2022/09/2022_07_19_rra_agreement_final.pdf\">agreement_final.pdf (coara.eu)</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/\">EURAXESS |</a></p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p><strong>Background and scope</strong></p><p>Fossil fuels supply a majority of the world’s energy and also provide the raw materials, or feedstocks, for many essential everyday products. While energy provision is becoming increasingly decarbonized, the production of fuels, chemicals and materials requires carbon atoms as feedstocks. However, their production can be “de-fossilized”, by utilising renewable energy and alternative carbon sources. Likewise, a circular economy approach offers scope to reduce external dependencies and source other essential molecular feedstocks including critical raw materials from wastes.</p><p>This Pathfinder Challenge therefore focuses on the development of next generation technologies that turn today’s problematic waste streams into essential building blocks of a future circular economy. Furthermore, it specifically focusses on currently non- or hard-to-recycle types of synthetic polymer materials (including among other mixtures of different types of plastics, polymeric composite materials, micro-/nanoplastics, untreated plastic waste, diapers, rubber, etc.), flue gases, wastewater and seawater desalination brines. Proposals must target real-life industrial and household waste streams where current recycling methods face insurmountable barriers e.g., due to impurities, the presence of noxious additives, inseparable material mixtures or nonbiodegradable materials. An important side effect is the remediation of waste streams with respect to micro-/nanoplastics, trace metals and noxious substances. These novel technologies should be scalable, easily applicable and deliver products with higher economic value as compared to waste destruction.</p><p>The scope of technological solutions addressed in this Challenge is limited to the following technologies with currently low Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), where significant synergies by working in a Challenge portfolio are expected: solar reforming and synthetic biology devices, brine mining and integrated capture and conversion technologies. Microbial-based and photocatalytic remediation processes are included as well. Computational material science and AI, and bottom-up synthetic biology are supported as key enablers at the fundamental research level.</p><p>Thermochemical approaches (such as pyrolysis or gasification) and “dark” (not lightdriven) chemical recycling are out-of-scope of this Pathfinder Challenge. Likewise, food and biomass waste, traditional bulk metal waste, glass, paper, cardboard and mono-PET waste are also out of scope.</p><p><strong>Specific objectives</strong></p><p>The Challenge seeks ambitious proposals that address one (and only one) of the following focus areas:</p><p><strong>Area 1: Fully integrated waste-to-value devices </strong></p><p>This includes 1) devices for converting waste streams into (feedstock for) fuels, chemicals and materials and 2) devices for remediation; where processes are solely driven by renewable energy sources (preferably directly by sunlight) and focus on the selective production of added value products, beyond hydrogen as the sole end product:</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\" level=\"0\">  <li>Fully integrated solar reforming or synthetic biology devices, enabling the treatment of synthetic polymer materials, while delivering fast and efficient decomposition under sustainable reaction conditions (including the use of process chemicals).</li><li>Integrated capture and conversion technologies, capturing and converting feedstock from flue gases, or wastewater in a single step/ single device into fuels, chemicals and materials, providing increased energy- and materials efficiency as compared to not fully integrated process chains.</li><li>Membrane-based and electrochemical brine mining technologies recovering raw materials, CO2 and water from seawater desalinisation brines.</li><li>Ex-situ remediation devices based on microbial/enzymatic and/or photocatalytic degradation, both purifying wastewater and seawater of noxious substances, metals, or nano-/microplastics, and producing added value remediation products. This should take place in a reactor, not in the open field.</li> </ol><p>Proposals addressing only parts of the full waste-to-value process (e.g., half reactions) will not be considered. Integrated hybrid approaches, at the interface of various disciplines, and autonomously operating devices continuously optimized with AI, are particularly welcome. The resulting devices must reach TRL 4 within the 3–4-year project lifetime.</p><p>The associated processes must not down-cycle the waste substrate but create products of higher economic and environmental value as compared to the initial waste stream. They must be energy and material-efficient and fully sustainable, minimising the associated energy, water, chemicals and land footprint. Operating conditions (e.g., related to temperature, pressure and the use of additional chemicals) should be optimised and the circular use of process consumables, such as water, catalyst materials or chemical additives maximised. They must deploy environmentally safe, stable materials, with non-toxic degradation products and the developed devices must be recyclable-by-design.</p><p>Proposals must take a holistic view of the complete waste valorisation chain by optimising the different elements (pre-treatment, conversion, product separation and storage) with respect to one another. The systems must also be robust and easy-to-handle to allow operations that are independent from large-scale infrastructures, with extended lifetimes and a capability to treat real-life waste streams which have undergone minimal sorting and pre-treatment.</p><p>Proposals have to clearly indicate how the proposed solution benchmarks against industrially deployed recycling methods such as mechanical recycling, composting, biogas fermentation or waste-to-energy technologies, and emerging recycling methods such as chemical recycling or thermochemical approaches.</p><p><strong>Area 2: Understanding underlying mechanisms by means of computational material science and AI </strong></p><p>Projects in this focus area must deliver advances and scientific breakthroughs in the fundamental understanding of the underlying physical, chemical, and biological processes that will enable fully sustainable and scalable waste-to-value devices. Projects should address all the following specific objectives:</p><p>- Explore fundamental phenomena crucial to multiple waste-to-value device types, such as the development of efficient, stable and inexpensive catalysts, interface engineering and the effect of the surrounding medium.</p><p>- Develop more accurate and less resource-intensive quantum mechanical and AI methods to guide, predict and interpret reliably experimental works.</p><p>- Bridge the scales from describing properties at the atomic, mesoscopic level up to the macroscopic device level within a multiscale approach and describe phenomena over different timescales.</p><p>- Adopt a holistic approach to exploring phenomena applicable to multiple waste-to-value device types (aligned with Area 1). Devices stemming from Area 1 should serve to validate the developed theoretical models.</p><p><strong>Area 3: Cells from scratch by means of bottom-up synthetic biology</strong></p><p>Projects in this area must look to deliver scientific breakthroughs in bottom-up synthetic biology to enable the use of tailored microbial cell factories for the degradation and valorisation of waste and the production of fossil-free fuels, chemicals, and materials. Projects should address all the following specific objectives:</p><p>- Develop synthetic, fully artificial cells for future large-scale biotechnology applications, tailored to deliver desired functionalities such as carbon fixation or synthetic polymer decomposition.</p><p>- Engineer cell-like systems to produce compounds from abundantly available building blocks, such as water and carbon oxides.</p><p>- Engineer cell-like systems to decompose diverse types of waste, in particular synthetic plastic waste, into compounds that are valorisable as feedstock for a downstream production of fuels, chemicals and materials. At this stage, systems will not have to be completely autonomous and self-replicating, but the integration of different modules should be implemented.</p><p><strong>Expected outcomes and impacts </strong></p><p>This Challenge is in line with REPowerEU and Fit for 55. It is compliant with the Renewable Energy Directive, the Waste Framework Directive and the Critical Raw Materials Act. It supports the EU’s Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) and the herein included Plastics strategy. It builds on the Industrial Carbon Management strategy, the Communication on Sustainable Carbon Cycles, and the Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources.</p><p>The portfolio of projects selected under this Challenge are expected to collectively cover Areas 1, 2 and 3. A maximum of one proposal from each of Areas 2 and 3 will be selected, whereas the aim for Area 1 is to select proposals that cover as many device categories (i-iv) as possible. Combining these three aspects into a single portfolio with close interaction between the projects and a commonly developed vision is expected to significantly speed up the innovation journey by driving synergies and mutual learning.</p><p>The resulting portfolio of projects will in time contribute to:</p><p>- Local energy and resource supply, allowing communities and remote areas to have access to reliable and sustainable waste recycling, supporting the local production of fuels, chemicals and materials. Reduction/ eventual independence from the importation of critical raw materials in the context of increasing demand for such materials for renewable energy and fuel technologies.</p><p>- Increased share of recycled waste, minimizing waste disposal in open dumps, landfills and incineration and the related negative impacts on our environment.</p><p>- Micro-/nano plastic removal, towards a zero-brine discharge.</p><p>- Decentralised, circular production of fuels, chemicals and materials where waste serves as an indispensable local resource enabling on-site production replacing fossil resources. Reduction in the demand for fossil fuels alongside associated CO2 and pollutant emissions reductions.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p><strong>Background and scope</strong></p><p>Robotic automation offers significant advantages to several sectors, yet on-site construction robotics is amongst the most challenging and least understood fields in robotics. The unstructured, dynamic environment with human presence makes navigation and automation of the many concurrent construction tasks deeply challenging. Further, the current state-of-the-art solutions focus on adding higher degrees of automation to legacy tools, such as heavy equipment designed for diesel engines and human operators.</p><p>Radical innovations are essential for the sector to address the unprecedented wave of building growth, especially in the context of labour shortages, a productivity gap between the construction and other industries, rising expectations for occupational health and safety, and the need for healthier and more affordable living environments.</p><p>Through the collaboration of multiple agents (both humans and machines) construction processes can be accelerated, enabling more complex processes with multiple tasks to be performed simultaneously and collaboratively. Multi-robotic collaboration, where robotic agents support and complement each other’s tasks and skill sets within the same workspace, may unlock entirely new processes that are not possible using single robotic machines. This approach could involve multiple distributed “swarms” of collaborative robots using distributed control algorithms and robot learning systems, which may be better suited to large, spatially distributed tasks and can adapt to unpredictable environments. Doing so while also supporting the electrification of the (legacy suite of) construction equipment, will help break with the need to go for ever larger machines and facilitate the development of novel technologies that enable efficient accurate and reliable control, and the adoption of collaborative robots that are suitable for commercial on-site construction environments.</p><p>Realising the disruptive potential of novel emerging technology paradigms that reconsider construction processes from the fundamentals can help supplant and substitute the legacy suite of tools with novel autonomous collaborative construction robots in an integrated, “designed-for-robotics” digital production and assembly chain.</p><p>Such developments could also further enhance an emerging paradigm shift from today’s complex mix of on-site construction tasks, towards a future of off-site fabrication and on-site assembly. Off-site fabrication offers industrial economic advantages of producing modularized building elements at scale in a controlled, digitalized and automated factory environment. For the construction sector this paradigm shift can deliver demand-side emissions reductions, by implementing strategies of digitalized structural efficiency and novel materials, as well as of zeroemission construction sites through electrification.</p><p>This Pathfinder Challenge aims to address all construction tasks typically required for site preparation, substructure, and superstructure, as well as the coordination between 43 these tasks to support a transition towards building with autonomous electrified construction equipment. It includes the role of human agents in construction processes, as even high degrees of multi-robotic autonomy with low degrees of supervision will require a collaborative connection between human and robotic agents, ensuring they can safely collaborate and share the same workspace.</p><p><strong>Specific objectives</strong></p><p>The overall objective of this Challenge is the development of breakthrough technologies in the domain of autonomous collaborative on-site construction robots for an integrated, designed-for-robotics, digital production and assembly chain.</p><p>The Challenge is open to the 3 main construction tasks applied to the 2 main construction segments of buildings and infrastructure. Innovative application in adjacent construction segments (for example coastal protection foundations for energy infrastructure) also fall within scope.</p><p>Each funded project shall deliver the following 3 specific objectives:</p><p><strong><u>Objective 1: </u></strong></p><p>Development of a simplified structural, load-bearing, material-robot building system to assemble a representative and future-relevant structure (pavilion) using a multitude of discrete modules (elements, segments, blocks, voussoirs). This system must demonstrate TRL4 (validation in laboratory environment) of the autonomous collaborative multirobotic assembly. The structure can represent an infrastructure (for example a bridge, tunnel, culvert, conduit), a building (for example a tower, vault, dome, arch, multi-story skeleton, wall) or other construction elements (for example a foundation, secant wall, barrier, sea wall). The building system can also integrate unprocessed and pre-processed in-situ building materials (rocks, sand, natural materials, demolition materials, disassembled elements). Projects are expected to demonstrate the technologies at least at a relevant human scale in terms of volume, mass and moment of inertia, and ideally at a larger real-world architectural scale, rather than at a laboratory desktop scale.</p><p>Solutions are expected to incorporate “design-for-robotic-assembly” aspects, such as the robot-material interfaces, module interfaces and connectors, and may include innovative approaches such as embedded sensing in the modules.</p><p>A virtual simulation of the disassembled state, various intermediate assembly stages (including temporary (robotic) support measures if necessary) and final assembled state is expected to be part of the systems development process. The project should include a documented validation of key design decisions (for example materials used 44 or configurations that simulate scaled behaviour) against the minimal requirements of the TRL4 demonstration objectives of the autonomous mobile multi-robotic collaborative platform.</p><p><strong><u>Objective 2:</u></strong></p><p>Development of an autonomous mobile multi-robotic collaborative platform using at least two, preferably more, mutually aware collaborative robotic systems specifically designed for the assembly tasks outlined in Objective 1. This objective requires a structured systems engineering approach to conduct a thorough functional system analysis and to allocate system-level functions between humans and machines within the target autonomous mobile multi-robotic collaborative platform.</p><p>The design should include the definition of system states and modes, along with the transitions between them, to ensure safe autonomous operations and effective demonstration of robot-robot and human-robot collaborations and interactions (passive, active, adaptive) at TRL4.</p><p>The project should also describe how the proposed technology can be scaled to meet the full dimensions of the intended commercial application in future.</p><p>Utilizing existing industrial robots or modifying suitable existing construction tools is allowed. However, these approaches may face workspace limitations when scaled to full commercial dimensions. Conversely, novel relative multi-robotic platforms could make full use of the opportunities of the material-robot system independent of scaling limitations in future.</p><p><strong><u>Objective 3:</u></strong></p><p>Achieve a TRL4 demonstration of an autonomous assembly sequence using the demonstration building system developed in Objective 1, executed by the autonomous mobile multi-robotic collaborative platform developed in Objective 2. The demonstration of a subsequent disassembly sequence is optional but encouraged if the building system is designed for disassembly. The demonstration will take place in a laboratory environment, including tests that explore the system’s resilience and limits under controlled unstructured real-world conditions (for example fault tolerance, granular uneven surfaces, environmental obstacles). These tests aim to identify key weaknesses and recommend future technology developments.</p><p>The specific objective of this challenge is to advance the digitalized chain of off-site modular production with on-site autonomous mobile multi-robotic collaborative assembly. Therefore, on-site 3D-printing of cementitious materials or polymers as a primary construction task is outside the scope of this challenge.</p><p><strong>Expected Outcomes and Impacts:</strong></p><p>This Challenge contributes to the European Green Deal, the European AI Strategy, and the key strategic orientations of Horizon Europe for the digital and green transitions of the construction sector. The anticipated impacts of this Challenge include addressing likely shortages and competition in the labour markets, enhancing productivity and competitiveness within the construction industry, and improving worker safety. It will facilitate a shift towards offsite industrial fabrication coupled with onsite assembly and disassembly, reducing emissions from on-site construction activities, and lowering costs and mitigating risks associated with construction projects. This Challenge will also serve as a lighthouse for industrialization in important policy areas, such as affordable housing, the renovation wave, circular construction, and infrastructure development.</p><p>The field of mobile construction robotics, in particular heterogeneous collaborative robots assembling discrete building elements, is challenging and multi-disciplinary. Given the nascent state of the enabling technologies, the cumulative impact of the portfolio of Pathfinder projects is expected to surpass that of individual projects. Consortia will benefit from mutual learning and the exchange of approaches and expertise in areas such as mapping, navigating and building awareness of unstructured environments, force-aware manipulation, swarm collectives, as well as commercialisation pathways.</p><p>Furthermore, consortia will be encouraged to collaborate on developing performance metrics and communicate their outputs to the broader public with a view to accelerating the adoption of these radical innovations by the sector. Such valuable joint portfolio activities are anticipated to be discussed and agreed upon by the funded projects.</p><p>The portfolio of projects selected will aim to cover a complementary set of projects that span the “application” and “approach” fields specified below and combinations thereof:</p><p>- Applications fields (super-structure, sub-structure, site-preparation, building, infrastructure, other construction, target type of environment).</p><p>- Approach (type of robot, number of agents, coordination strategy, level of autonomy, strategy for stability during assembly sequence, multi-modal sensors, resilience strategy for environmental variability, type of discrete building elements and fixations, level of integration of material-robot system).</p><p><strong>Specific conditions </strong></p><p>Applications for this Challenge with elements that concern the evolution of European communication networks (5G, post-5G and other technologies linked to the evolution of European communication networks) will be subject to restriction for the protection of European communication networks (see Annex II – Section B1)</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p><strong>Background and scope</strong></p><p>Imaging is a crucial component of cancer clinical protocols, providing detailed morphological, structural, metabolic, and functional information. However, harnessing the full potential of the data generated through medical imaging in clinical settings remains challenging. Clinicians often struggle to combine diverse and large-scale data into a comprehensive view of patient care, disease progression, and treatment efficacy. The inability to seamlessly integrate and interpret diverse data sources result in suboptimal patient outcomes and inefficiencies in the delivery of healthcare.</p><p>The integration of traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) with medical imaging can transform healthcare, but most existing applications are still in their infancy and must overcome a number of challenges to accelerate adoption. These include AI applications being confined to single data modalities, which restricts their overall effectiveness (Monomodal Application); inadequate and insufficient data training, leading to data scarcity and a lack of generalizability, making them less reliable across diverse patient populations, including with regard to gender-sensitivity; and the lack of AI model interpretability, as many AI systems function as \"black boxes,\" providing little insight into their decision-making processes. This lack of transparency limits trust in the systems and their usability in clinical settings.</p><p>The goal of this Pathfinder Challenge is to create interactive GenAI autonomous agents and/or a combination of them (super-agent) that provide clinicians with a holistic end to end perspective of patient care, throughout the entire clinical pathway. These agents aim to enhance pattern identification, reduce inconsistencies and errors in diagnoses as well as improve cancer treatment. While the focus is on GenAI, we also encourage the integration of other advanced AI technologies, such as topological and geometric deep learning, neural fields, graph neural networks, etc., which can complement and enhance the robustness and effectiveness of GenAI-based solutions in addressing the challenges of cancer diagnosis and therapy.</p><p>The Challenge will support early-stage groundbreaking research projects that will develop and validate novel approaches and concepts for integrating and interpreting multimodal medical imaging and health data. Additionally, it will involve generating reliable synthetic medical data, which will also be pooled to form a common database and used for the development of advanced algorithms.</p><p><strong>Specific Objectives</strong></p><p>Project proposals under this Challenge should focus on one (and only one) of the following diseases: breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, brain cancer, stomach cancer or colorectal cancer.</p><p>Each proposal should address both the following areas (at least one sub-objective from each of the areas):</p><p><strong>Area 1: Technological area</strong></p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\" level=\"0\">  <li>GenAI-based tools for Integrating Multidimensional Multimodal health Data</li> </ol><p>Investigate groundbreaking techniques and methodologies for developing GenAI algorithms that combine multidimensional (e.g. time dimension, space dimension) and multimodal data from various sources. These include multiple imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT, PET, X-ray), clinical data (e.g., electronic health records, lab results, structured and unstructured clinical data, pathology results, genetics and – omics data, videos, knowledge databases, and other resources). The goal is to provide a comprehensive view of the patient’s condition. The developed algorithms should be capable of producing unified and actionable datasets that can be exploited for the development of the AI tools described in Area 2 (clinical).</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\" level=\"0\">  <li>Medical Data Augmentation</li> </ol><p>Develop GenAI models based on groundbreaking techniques that are in the conceptual or initial experimental phase for medical data augmentation. These models should be capable of creating highly realistic synthetic medical data (images, genomics data, etc.) and generating complementary data from existing sources (for example producing synthetic CT images from MRI images), to support iterative cycles of model training.</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\" level=\"0\">  <li>Medical Knowledge Representation and Integration</li> </ol><p>Create an initial prototype GenAI model for medical knowledge representation and integration. This model should aim to develop a comprehensive and dynamic medical knowledge base, to identify discrete medical imaging features associated with demographic information and systemic conditions, to improve the interpretability of AI-based models and extract new knowledge not previously identifiable by experts without assistance.</p><p><strong>Area 2: Clinical Area</strong></p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\" level=\"0\">  <li>Predictive Diagnosis</li> </ol><p>Develop an interactive autonomous agent capable of assessing the likelihood of a patient developing cancer by analysing their medical history, imaging data, and genetic information. The agent should provide personalised health risk predictions, enabling early detection and preventive measures.</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\" level=\"0\">  <li>Enhance Personalized Treatment Selection</li> </ol><p>Develop novel AI algorithms and architectures that leverages multidimensional and multimodal data integration, along with synthetic data generation, to predict the optimal treatment pathway for specific patient conditions, as well as to forecast disease progression and treatment efficacy providing a comprehensive view of patient care.</p><p>Appropriate performance metrics should be considered for the continuous evaluation and testing of the scientific and technical robustness (including accurately quantify uncertainties) of all developed algorithms and architectures in Areas 1 and 2. Rigorous testing against diverse datasets is essential to ensure that the models perform reliably across various patient demographics and conditions, thereby reducing the risk of skewed results and ensuring precision from diagnoses to therapy.</p><p>Projects should also conduct proof of concept studies in controlled settings to demonstrate improved and more accurate diagnosis and treatment when compared to current clinical practice. The viability of the developed technologies should be evaluated, guiding further refinement and improvement. For instance, a super-agent could be validated for assisting and/or replacing clinicians through the whole clinical pathway of the patient, providing a holistic view of patient care, that is currently unachievable due to fragmented healthcare systems and associated expertise.</p><p>The focus should also be on enhancing the interpretability of AI models/agents, making their decision-making processes more transparent and understandable to clinicians. This could involve developing cutting-edge techniques such as causal inference methods, explainable AI frameworks, or novel visualization tools that provide deeper insights into AI decision-making processes.</p><p>The AI models developed under this Challenge are expected to comply with the EU concept for Trustworthy AI, relevant ethical principles, and the AI Act. In addition to focusing on performance, careful attention must be given to data quality, transparency, privacy, and security.</p><p>Proposers are encouraged to leverage the data and tools available in the Cancer Image Europe platform (deployed in the context of the European Cancer Imaging Initiative) for their proposed work. In turn they should contribute the datasets, and developed AI tools and models to the platform under agreed conditions. All datasets produced should be described where possible with metadata records in the EU dataset catalogue of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) using the Health DCAT-AP metadata standard.</p><p>Projects that address only one of the two ‘Areas’ or other cancer types will be considered \"out\" of scope.</p><p><strong>Expected Outcomes and Impacts:</strong></p><p>In support of the European AI Strategy and the Cancer Plan for Europe and the Cancer Mission this Challenge looks to support the development of the next generation models for cancer diagnosis and treatment, with Generative AI.</p><p>This Challenge aims to create a collaborative environment where diverse expertise — including for example data science, informatics, oncology, radiology, pathology, medical physics, bioinformatics, geneticists, healthcare administrators, and patient advocacy groups — converges to address the complexities of developing autonomous agents for holistic patient care, through enhanced diagnosis and personalized treatment.</p><p>The Challenge aspires to significantly improve patient care and reduce pressure on the healthcare system by leveraging advanced interactive autonomous agents for diagnosis and personalized treatment. By alleviating the burdens on clinicians and ensuring compliance with the EU concept for Trustworthy AI, the initiative will enhance the quality and reliability of medical services. Economically, it promises substantial cost reductions and cost avoidance, leading to long-term improvements in healthcare efficiency and sustainability. Ultimately, this challenge will foster innovation and establish Europe as a leader in the field, delivering profound benefits to patients, healthcare providers, and society at large.</p><p>The portfolio of selected projects will be designed to deliver a set of agents/models for improved diagnosis and personalized treatment of the above-mentioned cancers. Specifically, the projects will collaborate to:</p><p>- Create a shared database of synthetically generated images to be used across all projects for the development of their algorithms;</p><p>- Compare the use of a combination of the agents in the case of multiple cancers;</p><p>- Benchmark agents for enhanced diagnosis and personalized treatment selection;</p><p>- Define innovative clinical pathways in oncology;</p><p>- Externally validate the developed agents within a project at clinical premises of another project in the portfolio;</p><p>- Develop standardized methods and frameworks for evaluating AI- Act and Medical Device Regulation (MDR)- compliant generative AI models.</p><p>The portfolio of projects to be funded under this Challenge will be composed in such a way that they address ideally all cancers mentioned in this call, apply different technologies, and provide access to relevant clinical facilities and research infrastructures. The following categories will be used for the composition:</p><p>Category 1 – type of cancer</p><p>Category 2 – type of technology</p><p>Category 3 – access to appropriate infrastructure data and ecosystem integration.</p><p><strong>Specific conditions</strong></p><p>Applications for this Challenge with elements that concern the evolution of European communication networks (5G, post-5G and other technologies linked to the evolution of European communication networks) will be subject to restriction for the protection of European communication networks (see Annex II – Section B1)</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p><strong>Background and scope</strong></p><p>Land based agricultural production is the source of approximately 95% of human food nutrients (UN FAO). Intensive and often inappropriate practices in agriculture have however resulted in severe soil degradation, thereby reducing the capacity of soils to support food production and other important ecosystem services such as the regulation of water, nutrients, and carbon cycles. Soil degradation is further accelerated by the effects of climate change, with abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, salinity, and waterlogging, often in combination, having negative effects on the world’s crop production. The direct impact of a changed climate is also frequently accompanied by indirect impacts due to alterations in the composition and behaviour of weeds, insects, pathogens, and soil microbiome, alongside the impacts of increased amounts of human-generated pollutants.</p><p>Plants react to such stresses with what are often conflicting physiological and metabolic responses. These may prioritise one acclimatisation/adaptation strategy over the other, a blend of one or more responses, and/or through developing a completely new strategy, all of which can, in turn, impact final production including nutrient content.</p><p>When combined with an increasing human population, likely to increase net demand for food, there is a clear rationale to reinforce existing food and nutrient production systems and explore complementary routes to food production that are more efficient, resilient, sustainable and maintain or increase biodiversity.</p><p>This Pathfinder Challenge therefore aims to support projects that enhance adaptation pathways for the production of climate-resilient crops and develop alternative pathways to produce high value ingredients in plants by increasing nutrient profile of crops based on plant native and/or non-native ingredients.</p><p><strong>Specific Objectives</strong></p><p>Innovative ideas put forward under this Challenge must go beyond incremental changes to the state-of-the-art and result in novel production processes that must deliver energy- and resource-efficient, low emission foods that maintain or increase biodiversity and are integral to a healthy diet.</p><p>Funded projects are expected to develop breakthrough technologies that reach TRL4 (validation in laboratory environment) with viable plants at the end of the projects. The proposals should work on both the following objectives:</p><p>• Increasing plant growth, yields and resistance to stress through:</p><p> o Enhancing tolerance to stress combinations occurring due to different climate scenarios that include the simultaneous exposure of crops to different stresses e.g. heat combined with drought, salinity, flooding, high CO2 levels, as well as indirect effect of climate change via altered composition and behaviour of weeds, insects, pathogens and soil microbiome and possible impact of human-generated pollutants.</p><p> o Increasing water use efficiency and nutrient use efficiency compared to current crops in commercial use.</p><p> o Improving plant reproduction and seed filling processes under unfavourable conditions caused by combination of at least two stress factors.</p><p> o Investigating and enhancing plant and soil microbiome interactions.</p><p>• Substantially increasing the nutritional value (e.g. proteins, vitamins) in crops through plant native and non-native ingredients in crops.</p><p>Projects must also develop a complete methodology for assessing the increase of plant growth, yields, and climate resilience to single and multiple stresses, and/or assess changes to the nutritional value of crops, as appropriate. Proposals should include multi-omics approaches including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and phenomics. These approaches can be further underpinned by leveraging technologies such as, but not limited to nanoparticle technology, chemistry, and advanced artificial intelligence to develop and introduce novel defence and acclimation strategies, currently not present in crops to achieve greater tolerance to harsh environmental conditions and/or biomanufacturing of non-native ingredients, to enable the time required for that development to be significantly shortened. Proposals should also look to address the narrow genetic diversity of novel crops and are also expected to consider regulatory aspects and to build on the work carried out so far by the European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA), where appropriate.</p><p><strong>Expected Outcomes and Impacts:</strong></p><p>In support of Building the future with nature: Boosting Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing in the EU, the Mission Soil, the EU Green Deal, Farm to Fork strategy, the Nature Restoration Law, Fit for 55, and REPowerEU policy actions, the key overall goal of this Challenge is to support the production of sustainable and nutritious food from plants.</p><p>This Challenge aims to support the development of climate smart crops and the production of high value plant native and non-native ingredients in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner. In the medium to long-term this will:</p><p>• Improve the sustainability, efficiency, biodiversity and resilience of the European food supply chain.</p><p>• Secure long-term competitiveness of EU Food supply chain while decreasing EU dependency on imports of inputs for primary production, feed, and food.</p><p>The following principles will be used to select the portfolio of projects:</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\" level=\"0\">  <li>Selected projects for the portfolio should have a synergy with one another in terms of a common component, for instance projects address similar stress factors for different crops or are leveraging a similar technology.</li><li>A balanced representation of native and non-native ingredients.</li><li>A balanced representation of conventional and New Genomic Techniques (NGTs).</li><li>Diverse type of crops to ensure that the portfolio covers a broad spectrum, if possible, ensuring European geographical coverage where these crops are grown.</li><li>Diverse stress factor combinations to ensure that a broad spectrum of stress factors is covered.</li><li>Diversity in technological approaches to compare their efficiency.</li> </ol><p>All projects will participate in a work package dedicated to the development of monitoring and prediction methodologies for climate adaptation assessment and lifecycle-analysis.</p>"

It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions. The Researchers at Schools activities should take place at any time during the project duration and should be subject to a dedicated promotion, particularly towards schools and other pedagogical and educational centres.</p><p>Involvement of researchers funded by Horizon Europe or previous Framework Programmes, notably by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, is highly encouraged.</p><p>Both the European Researchers’ Night and Researchers at Schools initiative should promote gender balance, diversity and inclusiveness in science in terms of planned activities and researchers involved.</p><p>The European Commission has defined priorities, notably through the EU Missions, which aim to tackle challenges faced by our societies. Applicants are encouraged to focus on, and include activities relating to these priorities identified by the Missions in their events.</p><p>Partnerships and coordination at regional, national or cross-border levels will be strongly encouraged aiming at a good geographical spread and avoiding overlaps. Activities carried-out in non-associated third countries are not eligible for funding.</p><p>High-quality applications not retained due to lack of funding may be granted the status of associated events.</p><p>Eligible costs will take the form of lump sum contributions as stipulated in Decision of 11 March 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions and unit contributions for Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions under the Horizon Europe Programme.</p><p>Applicants are encouraged to submit proposals covering activities for both 2026 and 2027, including the organisation of two successive editions<sup>[2]</sup> (2026 and 2027) of the European Researchers’ Night and implementation of Researchers at Schools activities during the project duration.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Except for countries which for strong cultural reasons would be prevented from organising any action addressing the public at large on such a date.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] The expected contribution for projects covering two editions of the European Researchers’ Night and Researchers at Schools activities is between EUR 0.1 and 0.3 million, but this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting different amounts.</p>"

The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions. The Researchers at Schools activities should take place at any time during the project duration and should be subject to a dedicated promotion, particularly towards schools and other pedagogical and educational centres.</p><p>Involvement of researchers funded by Horizon Europe or previous Framework Programmes, notably by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, is highly encouraged.</p><p>Both the European Researchers’ Night and Researchers at Schools initiative should promote gender balance, diversity and inclusiveness in science in terms of planned activities and researchers involved.</p><p>The European Commission has defined priorities, notably through the EU Missions, which aim to tackle challenges faced by our societies. Applicants are encouraged to focus on, and include activities relating to these priorities identified by the Missions in their events.</p><p>Partnerships and coordination at regional, national or cross-border levels will be strongly encouraged aiming at a good geographical spread and avoiding overlaps. Activities carried-out in non-associated third countries are not eligible for funding.</p><p>High-quality applications not retained due to lack of funding may be granted the status of associated events.</p><p>Eligible costs will take the form of lump sum contributions as stipulated in Decision of 11 March 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions and unit contributions for Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions under the Horizon Europe Programme.</p><p>Applicants are encouraged to submit proposals covering activities for both 2026 and 2027, including the organisation of two successive editions<sup>[2]</sup> (2026 and 2027) of the European Researchers’ Night and implementation of Researchers at Schools activities during the project duration.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Except for countries which for strong cultural reasons would be prevented from organising any action addressing the public at large on such a date.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] The expected contribution for projects covering two editions of the European Researchers’ Night and Researchers at Schools activities is between EUR 0.1 and 0.3 million, but this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting different amounts.</p>"

They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions. The Researchers at Schools activities should take place at any time during the project duration and should be subject to a dedicated promotion, particularly towards schools and other pedagogical and educational centres.</p><p>Involvement of researchers funded by Horizon Europe or previous Framework Programmes, notably by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, is highly encouraged.</p><p>Both the European Researchers’ Night and Researchers at Schools initiative should promote gender balance, diversity and inclusiveness in science in terms of planned activities and researchers involved.</p><p>The European Commission has defined priorities, notably through the EU Missions, which aim to tackle challenges faced by our societies. Applicants are encouraged to focus on, and include activities relating to these priorities identified by the Missions in their events.</p><p>Partnerships and coordination at regional, national or cross-border levels will be strongly encouraged aiming at a good geographical spread and avoiding overlaps.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised.

Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions.

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions.

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: </p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Improved, modern and validated tools, skills, methodologies and innovative training curricula for practitioners involved in humanitarian demining and Unexploded Ordnance Disposal (UXO) of civil areas, taking into account all applicable legislation and fundamental rights; </li><li>Improved education activities aimed at reducing risks of injuries from anti-personnel mines and other unexploded ordnance; </li><li>Enhanced understanding of the key challenges and best practices related to humanitarian demining and to unexploded ordnance risk education taking into account the experience of Ukrainian participants;</li><li>Evidence-based support to policy-makers on shaping of the EU mine action. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>In post-conflict areas, lives of civilians are in danger and the return of economic activity is hindered because the land is contaminated by anti-personnel mines and other unexploded ordnance. The EU provides a continuous support to humanitarian demining activities in heavily mine-affected countries and regions all over the world, thus promoting peace, security, post-conflict reconstruction, as well as social and economic rehabilitation. In Ukraine, mine action is a critical aspect of the humanitarian emergency response, the goal of which is to support the return of the civilian population and the rebuilding of crucial civilian infrastructure. As part of their mine action operations, EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, such as Croatia, Cyprus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Armenia also strive to make their land completely free of anti-personnel mines and other explosive ordnance.</p><p>Humanitarian demining is not to be confused with military demining, which is the process undertaken by soldiers to clear a safe path so they can advance during conflict.</p><p>Various humanitarian demining initiatives have been developed, which often incur high costs and are typically slow because no mistakes are allowed. In addition, due to a large diversity of contaminated areas, types of anti-personnel mines and of their deployment methods, as well as a more complex contamination that includes unexploded ordnance and improvised explosive devices, there is no single solution to the problem. Finally, new anti-personnel mines are being developed and new mine deployment techniques being used. Therefore, new, improved, innovative or disruptive solutions, accompanied by related training curricula, are needed to enhance humanitarian demining activities in civil areas. Since the aim of humanitarian demining is to restore peace and security, it has to be complemented by an adequate risk education, raising awareness of civilians of the risks from anti-personnel mines and other unexploded ordnance, which will help them act in such a way that will reduce the risk to people and the environment. A range of risk education initiatives exist, but they usually lack, among others, collaboration with related Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), sustainability, and a comprehensive needs assessment aiming to improve their effectiveness. Within this topic, improved, modern and validated tools, skills, methodologies and innovative training curricula for practitioners are expected, which are adapted to regional and cross-border contexts.</p><p>Proposals should also explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU and international level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects<sup>[1]</sup>. Proposals are also expected to connect and create synergies and explore complementarities with other related initiatives in humanitarian demining and in explosive ordnance risk education.</p><p>Activities proposed within this topic should address both technological (humanitarian demining) and societal (explosive ordnance risk education) dimensions in a balanced way.</p><p>To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment, performed by the practitioners involved in the project, of the project’s mid-term outcomes.</p><p>Within this topic, the European Commission encourages all potential participants to create, where possible, opportunities for the affected persons and entities, in particular Ukrainian national mine action authorities, researchers and innovators, demining agencies or companies as well as NGOs.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] Such the TIRAMISU and DBOX projects funded under FP7; projects MUNIMAP, BASTA, ExPloTect; project(s) funded under HORIZON-CL3-2023-BM-01-02 – “Identify, inspect, neutralise Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) at sea”; project(s) funded under EMFAF-2023-PIA-FLAGSHIP-MUNITION – “Regional flagship projects supporting a sustainable blue economy in EU sea basins – submerged munitions in the Baltic Sea”; project(s) funded under PPPA-2024-MUNITIONS – “Saving our Seas – Reducing the danger of munitions dumped in European seas”.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome(s):</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enhanced European and global interoperability of existing tools and technologies and improved capacities to prevent, better prepare and respond to different types of disasters (natural and human-made) by various practitioners (e.g., firefighters, medical responders, civil protection). </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning (ML) tools is increasingly at the core of first responder’s decision-making processes, including situational awareness, analysis and planning. Besides the needs to develop AI and ML tools, ground technologies such as miniaturised sensors that can operate autonomously for a long period in harsh environments and are fast and easy to deploy are needed for threat detection (such as chemical, biological or radiological substances) and/or identification of victims and possible locations for intervention. In addition, responders need to exchange information (language, data, video, etc.) in a reliable, secure, and universal way, while emergency communications throughout the European Union also need to be strengthened<sup>[1]</sup>. In many instances, interoperability of tools, technologies and communication channels is still an open issue, requiring standard operating procedures, specific education, training and exercises of responders.</p><p>The European Commission is developing and implementing an EU Preparedness Union Strategy<sup>[2]</sup> following whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. The proposals’ outcomes should especially work towards supporting the Strategy and follow the recommendations of the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) to ensure a successful uptake to the end users. Under the open topic, proposals are welcome to testing / validate tools, technologies and data used in cross-border prevention, preparedness and responses to climate / geological / accidental fire disasters and chemical, biological or radiological emergency threats (including medical countermeasures) by different practitioner’s sectors in view of demonstrating their interoperability in real-case situations, with focus on the use of AI and ML tools, miniaturized sensors for threat detection and victim identification, and communication (including cross-border emergency communications).</p><p>Proposals are expected to address one of the following options focused on testing / validation of tools and technologies, and demonstration of their interoperability:</p><p><strong>Option a</strong>: Use of artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) tools to support first responder’s analysis, planning and decision-making;</p><p><strong>Option b</strong>: Miniaturized sensors for threat detection and victim identification;</p><p><strong>Option c</strong>: Information exchange / Communication among first responders in a reliable, secure and universal way, and cross-border emergency communications;</p><p><strong>Option d: </strong>Alert system to detect CBRN threats, integrating different systems at national, regional and European levels.</p><p>Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should also convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.</p><p>Proposals funded under this topic are expected to engage beyond the project consortium with disaster management authorities, Industry/SMEs and Standardisation Organisations during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the Disaster Risk Reduction community.</p><p>To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant practitioners, i.e., First Responders with expertise in the different types of natural or human-made threats, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment, performed by the practitioners involved in the project, of the project’s mid-term outcomes.</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.</p><p>Proposals that include solutions and/or methods that would contribute to a lower environmental impact and footprint, better cost-efficiency, better energy-efficiency, and/or better operational autonomy of the capabilities and solutions in this topic, would be welcome.</p><p>Proposals should plan their activities opting for the Financial Support to Third Parties in order to provide financial support to practitioners (first responders / disaster management authorities) for expanding the proposed work in terms of additional user groups, complementary assessments, technology- or methodology-testing activities and/or to SMEs as additional solution providers. From 5% up to 20% of the EU funding requested by the proposal may be allocated to the purpose of financial support to third parties.</p><p>Proposals must clearly describe the objectives and the expected results to be obtained, including the elements listed in the application template. Proposals are also expected to describe the methods and processes relevant to comply with the general eligibility conditions for financial support to third parties set out in General Annex B and to demonstrate effectiveness (impact).</p><p>Due to the scope of this topic, legal entities established in LAC (Latin America and Caribbean), African, and Central Asian countries are encouraged to participate.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of related research and innovation activities.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] Critical Communication System (EUCCS).

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Projects’ results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>A community of EU civil security practitioners with shared needs for innovative technology solutions, supported by an industrial base in particular SMEs and Startups, to access the public procurement market and scale up their business;</li><li>Procurers facilitate the commercialisation of innovative solutions by their successful suppliers through providing them with first customer references for the validation and first pilot deployment;</li><li>Increased opportunities for wide market uptake and economies of scale for the supply side through increased demand for innovative solutions, wide publication of results and where relevant contribution to standardisation, regulation or certification;</li><li>Supporting public procurers, to collectively implement PCPs to drive innovation from the demand side and open up wider commercialisation opportunities for companies in Europe to take or maintain international leadership in new markets that can deliver innovative solutions.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>As past experience shows that pre-commercial procurement opens up the procurement market for startups and enables the public sector to address societal challenges more effectively, public procurers should make more strategic use of PCP. Applicants are invited to submit proposals for PCP action to acquire Research and Development (R&amp;D) services and innovative civil security technology solutions.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate interest from a broader community of potential buyers, beyond the direct beneficiaries, who share similar needs and are open to jointly adopting the solutions developed, provided they are proven mature and operationally viable. The proposals must include an analysis of the state of the art and market landscape, aligning research activities with identified needs and presenting a range of technical alternatives to address the challenge. Furthermore, to stimulate dialogue with the supply side, public procurers are required to organise proposals should demonstrate sustainability of the action beyond the life of the project.</p><p>The proposals should build on the outcomes of CSA projects funded under previous work programmes aimed at creating <em>Stronger grounds for pre-commercial procurement of innovative security technologies</em>. The proposals should provide clear evidence to justify and de-risk the PCP action, demonstrating that the identified challenge is significant and necessitates a PCP action to mature certain technologies and compare alternatives. It must be shown that a consolidated group of practitioners and procurers with shared needs and requirements is committed to the PCP process, enabling informed decisions on future joint procurement of innovative solutions. Activities covered should include cooperation with policy makers to reinforce the national policy frameworks and mobilise substantial additional national budgets for PCP and innovation procurement in general beyond the scope of the project. The tendering process must be well-defined, supported by a draft plan, and include readiness of documentation and administrative procedures to ensure a compliant launch of the call for R&amp;D services under PCP rules.</p><p>Proposals must demonstrate commitment to exploiting project results beyond its conclusion, ensuring engagement with stakeholders and implementation of strategies for future uptake. Applicants should also clarify measures to ensure compliance with the principles of the EU Directive on public procurement, particularly those related to PCP. The required open market consultations should be completed in at least three EU Member States. Prior consultations conducted under previous CSA projects may be used, provided they ensured procurement viability and remain relevant to the current state of the art.</p><p>Involvement of procurement decision makers is needed to ensure that end solution(s) are adopted by public buyers, increasing the societal impact of the related research activities. Therefore, procurers should declare in the proposal their interest to pursue deployment of solutions resulting from the PCP in case the PCP delivers successful solutions and indicate whether they will:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>procure successful solution(s) as part of the PCP.</li><li>launch a separate follow-up procurement after the PCP to buy such type of solutions.</li><li>adopt successful solutions without the need to procure them (e.g. in case of open-source solutions).</li><li>foresee financial or regulatory incentives for others to adopt successful solutions (e.g. in case the final end-users of the solutions are not the procurers but for example citizens).</li> </ol><p>In these four cases, the procurers can implement the project as a fast-track PCP<sup>[1]</sup>. In the first case, the procurers must foresee the budget in the proposal to purchase at least one solution during the PCP. In the second case, the procurers should include in the proposal a deliverable that prepares the follow-up procurement to purchase such type of solution(s) after the PCP. In the first and third case, the procurers must foresee sufficient time during the project to deploy and validate that the solutions function well after installation. In the fourth case, the procurers can use financial support to third parties to provide financial incentives to final end-users to adopt the solutions, with a maximum budget of EUR 100.000.</p><p>Applicants should propose an implementation of the project that includes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>A minimal preparation stage dedicated to finalising the tendering documents package for a PCP call for tenders based on the technical input, and to define clear verification and validation procedures, methods and tools for the evaluation of the prototypes to be developed throughout the PCP phases.</li><li>Moreover, to ensure the sustainability and uptake of the developed solutions, proposals should outline clear plans for post-PCP activities. As outlined in the general annexes of the Horizon Europe Work Programme, the topic allows public buyers to use the fast-track PCP option (e.g. 2 instead of 3 phases) when they commit to buying or deploying the resulting solutions after the PCP. However, if such a commitment is not yet in place at the proposal stage, the call requires proposers to include a deliverable outlining concrete activities to prepare the ground for follow-up deployment or procurement after the PCP.</li><li>Launching the call for tenders for research and development services. The call for tenders should envisage a competitive development composed of different phases that would lead to at least 2 prototypes from 2 different providers to be validated in real operational environment at the end of the PCP cycle;</li><li>Conducting the competitive development of the prototypes following the PCP principles including a design phase, an integration and technical verification phase and a validation in real operational environment phase. In evaluating the proposals and the results of the PCP phases, the applicants should consider technical merit, feasibility and commercial potential of proposed research efforts.</li><li>Consolidating the results of the evaluation of the developed prototypes, extracting conclusions and recommendations from the validation process, and defining a strategy for a potential uptake of solutions inspired in the PCP outcomes, including a complete technical specification of the envisaged solutions and standardisation needs and/or proposals. This strategy should consider joint-cross border procurement schemes and exploit synergies with other EU and national non-research funds.</li> </ul><p>The applicants are expected to maximise the visibility of the project outcomes to the wide community of potential EU public buyers. Liaison with other civil security communities beyond those addressed by the project is encouraged in order to assess the possible reuse and extensibility of the identified solutions to different domains.</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] see General Annex H of the Horizon Europe Work Programme.</p>"

This system will perform or support civilian tasks like search and rescue, hazard assessment, and supply transport in areas too dangerous for human responders;</li><li>Enhanced remote sensing and situational awareness, creating sensor-based technologies that improve situational awareness for first responders and decision-makers, enabling them to assess disaster zones remotely and safely;</li><li>Autonomous navigation and search capabilities in dangerous environments focusing on technologies that enhance the ability of autonomous systems to perform search operations in low-visibility or smoky conditions, typical of areas impacted by bombings, fires, or other conflict-related incidents;</li><li>User-centred and real-world testing in environments that replicate the conditions of conflict zones and urban disasters;</li><li>Capacity building and training for autonomous system deployment providing specialised training guidelines for first responders and civil protection agencies to operate and maintain autonomous systems effectively in conflict scenarios. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Conflicts such as the Russian war against Ukraine and the overall geopolitical context marked by tensions and conflicts make it more pressing than ever to ensure that responders are equipped with advanced tools that not only enhance their capabilities, but also protect their lives and increase operational efficiency in extreme environments. These crises demand a new level of preparedness and resilience, where autonomous systems using cutting-edge technologies work in unison to support swift, coordinated, and safe responses.</p><p>In light of the ongoing conflicts and the complex, high-risk environments they present, this topic focuses on developing and deploying advanced autonomous systems specifically tailored for large-scale, multi-dimensional disasters and tailored to the challenges of conflict driven. These disasters, exacerbated by geopolitical conflict, severe infrastructure damage, and immediate safety threats to both civilians and responders, demand innovative and resilient solutions. The topic seeks to address the EU’s critical need for tools that protect infrastructure, services, and populations while enhancing resilience and operational readiness.</p><p>Through rigorous real-world testing and capacity-building programs, responders will be trained to integrate and manage these autonomous systems effectively, preparing them for rapid deployment in high-stakes scenarios. The project will focus on delivering innovative, durable, and efficient technological solutions that allow responding effectively to crises similar in complexity and danger in environments similar to the one of the war in Ukraine. By developing tools that address the unique operational and safety challenges posed by such scenarios, this topic will reinforce the EU’s preparedness to protect both citizens and first responders, ensuring swift, coordinated responses to complex crises across Europe and beyond.</p><p>Within this topic, the European Commission encourages all potential participants to create, where possible, opportunities for the affected persons and entities, in particular researchers and innovators previously active in Ukraine as well as Ukrainian researchers and innovators who are unable to return to Ukraine in the given circumstances.</p>"

The emphasis of the proposals should be on the human dependant abilities of critical infrastructure to cope with an adverse event, including their capacity to prepare for the crisis, absorb the impact, reduce the recovery time, and adapt by reducing future exposure and vulnerabilities. </p><p>To ensure the active involvement of, and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment, performed by the practitioners involved in the project, of the project’s mid-term outcomes.</p><p>Activities proposed within this topic should address both technological and societal dimensions of the tackled challenge in a balanced way. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of related research and innovation activities.</p><p>Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication, exploit complementarities, and use opportunities for increased impact. Similarly, coordination with projects funded under HORIZON-CL3-2025-INFRA-01-01: Open topic for improved preparedness for, response to and recovery from large-scale disruptions of European infrastructure.</p>"

Both this preparatory action and the future PCP action are open to proposals oriented to the acquisition of Research and Development (R&amp;D) services for the development of innovative technologies, systems, tools or techniques to enhance border security, to fight against crime and terrorism, to protect infrastructure and public spaces, and/or to make societies more resilient against natural or human-made disasters. </p><p>In preparing the grounds for a possible future PCP action, the outputs of this Coordination and Support Action (CSA) should take into consideration:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The policy priorities described in this Work Programme Part for the security areas mentioned above; </li><li>The EU Directive for public procurement and in particular with the provisions related to PCP; </li><li>The specific provisions and funding rates of PCP actions and the specific requirements for innovation procurement (PCP/PPI) supported by Horizon Europe grants, as stated in the General Annex H of the Horizon Europe Work Programme; </li><li>The guidance for attracting innovators and innovation, as explained in the European Commission Guidance on Innovation Procurement C(2021) 4320, in particular those measures oriented to reduce the barriers to high-tech start-ups and innovative SMEs. </li> </ul><p>During the course of the project, the applicants are expected to deliver clear evidence on a number of aspects in order to justify and de-risk a possible follow-up PCP action, including: </p><ul level=\"0\"><li>That the challenge is pertinent and that indeed a PCP action is required to complete the maturation cycle of certain technologies and to compare different alternatives; </li><li>That there is a consolidated group of potential buyers with common needs and requirements which are committed to carry out a PCP action in order to be able to take an informed decision on a future joint procurement of innovative solutions; </li><li>That there is a quantifiable and identifiable community of potential buyers (including and beyond those proposed as beneficiaries in the proposal) who would share to a wide extent the common needs and requirements defined and who could be interested in exploring further joint-uptake of solutions similar to those developed under the PCP, should these prove to be technologically mature and operationally relevant by the end of the project; </li><li>That the state of the art and the market (including research) has been explored and mapped, and that there are different technical alternatives to address the proposed challenge; </li><li>That a future PCP tendering process is clear, that a draft planning has been proposed and that the supporting documentation and administrative procedures will be ready on due time in order to launch the call for the acquisition of R&amp;D services according to the PCP rules;</li><li>That the technology developments to be conducted in the future PCP can be done in compliance with European societal values, fundamental rights and applicable legislation, including in the area of free movement of persons, privacy and protection of personal data;</li><li>That in developing technology solutions, societal and gender aspects (e.g., perception of security, possible side effects of technological solutions, societal resilience) can be taken into account in a comprehensive and thorough manner. </li> </ul><p>If the applicants intend to submit a proposal for a follow-up PCP in a future Horizon Europe Cluster 3 Work Programme, they should ensure that the above evidence is consolidated in the project deliverables of this CSA before the submission of the PCP proposal. </p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort. </p><p>The project should have a maximum estimated duration of 1 year.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome(s):</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Better understanding of the impact of disasters and crises, and improved early warnings and long-term planning linked to natural causes or to human-made threats (including CBRN) on risk governance, including emergency services, regional and/or local authorities, and citizen volunteers, and improved adaptation and resilience of emergency systems for disaster prevention and preparedness – especially in a multi-risk environment with cascading disasters. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Improved risk governance, adaptation and resilience requires authorities and communities to adopt risk and resilience management approaches, which are inclusive and innovative, through pre-defined plans and procedures, as well as through adaptable and flexible capabilities to prepare for, respond to, recover from and learn from disasters and crises. It requires the implementation of policies at different levels (international to regional and/or local) and strategies for a better understanding of impacts and enhanced risk preparedness and adaptation, which are co-developed and enabled through <em>all-of-society </em>engagement and participation, and hence strengthen resilience to disasters among authorities, decision-makers, private actors, intermediary actors, volunteers and citizens, and the most vulnerable.</p><p>The European Commission is developing and implementing an EU Preparedness Union Strategy<sup>[1]</sup> following whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. The proposals’ outcomes should especially work towards supporting the Strategy and follow the recommendations of the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) to ensure a successful uptake to the end users.</p><p>Under the open topic, proposals are welcome to address new, upcoming or unforeseen challenges and/or creative or disruptive solutions for an enhanced understanding of impacts of disasters and crises linked to natural or human-made causes on risk governance and improved resilience of emergency systems, that are not covered by topics of Horizon Europe Calls Disaster-Resilient Society 2023-2024. If they related to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Disaster-Resilient Society 2021-2022, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address one of the following options:</p><p><strong>Option a</strong>: Enhanced impact forecasting and early warning systems, understanding of climate / weather extreme events and geohazards and adaptation of emergency systems for disaster prevention and preparedness;</p><p><strong>Option b</strong>: Enhanced impact forecasting and understanding of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, Explosive (CBRN-E) threats and adaptation of emergency systems for disaster prevention preparedness and response (including medical countermeasures). Projects do not need to address all elements of CBRN-E.</p><p>Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should also convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.</p><p>Proposals funded under this topic are expected to engage beyond the project consortium with volunteers' organisations, regional and/or local authorities and disaster management authorities during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the Disaster Risk Reduction community.</p><p>To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant practitioners, i.e., emergency responders (with expertise in the different types of natural or human-made threats), proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment, performed by the practitioners involved in the project, of the project’s mid-term outcomes.</p><p>Due to the scope of this topic, legal entities established in LAC (Latin America and Caribbean), African, and Central Asian countries are encouraged to participate.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of related research and innovation activities.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] Europe’s choice – Political guidelines for the next European Commission 2024-2029, p. 14.</p>"

Contexts and scenarios in Europe’s border regions that may in the future be impacted by geopolitical instabilities, tensions from outside the EU or impact on the environment, and need sustained and improved surveillance and reaction capabilities, could be particularly considered. If they relate to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Effective Management of EU External Borders 2021-2022 or 2023-2024, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them.</p><p>Proposals may also address capabilities related to possible future detection of threats in the flow of goods and/or in the supply chain in a flexible, rapid, relocatable way. Detection capabilities could target one or more type(s) of dangerous, illicit and/or illegal goods or materials, including illicit drugs and their precursors, illegally traded species covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) considering the European Deforestation Free Products Regulation, contraband, chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRN-E) threats and/or various modi operandi related to cross-border trafficking, including involving cargo.</p><p>Projects should integrate aspects of:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>perspectives of safeguarding and promoting human rights, developing solutions that contribute to those safeguarding and promotion;</li><li>inputs from human rights, law and ethical perspectives, as well as the consideration and views of individuals and society, as appropriate; proposals can engage with citizens and civil society for wider input and support;</li><li>aspects of cybersecurity of the technology proposed, and the protection of communication systems and networks involved in the solutions, if and as relevant.</li> </ul><p>Proposals that include solutions and/or methods that would contribute to a lower environmental impact and footprint, better cost-efficiency, better energy-efficiency, and/or better operational autonomy of the capabilities and solutions in this topic, would be welcome.</p><p>Depending on the particular scope of the proposal, participation of Police Authorities, Border and/or Coast Guards is welcome.</p><p>To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project.</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.</p><p>Proposals should plan their activities opting for the financial support to third parties in order to provide financial support to additional (i.e., beyond those partners in the Consortium) practitioners (i.e., authorities with competences of Customs) to engage during the project for additional piloting, testing and/or validation of technologies or methods. From 5% up to 20% of the EU funding requested by the proposal may be allocated to the purpose of financial support to third parties.</p><p>Proposals must clearly describe the objectives and the expected results to be obtained, including the elements listed in the application template. Proposals are also expected to describe the methods and processes relevant to comply with the general eligibility conditions for financial support to third parties set out in General Annex B and to demonstrate effectiveness (impact).</p>"

If they related to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Fighting Crime and Terrorism 2021-2022, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them. Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should also convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects.</p><p>Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. If relevant, the active involvement, as beneficiaries, of Border Guard and/or Customs Authorities from EU Member States or Associated Countries is recommended.</p><p>The proposals funded under this topic that concern issues which are within the mandate of Europol<sup>[1]</sup> are expected to engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the law enforcement community. Similarly, if the proposals concern drug-related issues, they are expected to engage with the EU Drugs Agency during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes.</p><p>To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, i.e., Police Authorities and Border Guards / Customs Authorities, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment, performed by the practitioners involved in the project, of the project’s mid-term outcomes.</p><p>In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <u><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0794\">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0794</a></u><u> (Annex I)</u></p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Accurately gathered, stored, managed and preserved research training and testing data, disaggregated by gender if relevant, which is verified and selected in order to be realistic, up-to-date and sufficient, as well as to make research more trustworthy and reproducible;</li><li>Researchers and projects can further increase the impact and visibility of their work by not just archiving research materials, but also opening them up for reuse and citation by other relevant actors and stakeholders;</li><li>Properly shared and re-used relevant research data can save lives, help develop solutions and maximise the knowledge;</li><li>Enhanced collaboration among relevant research community, improved trust between researchers and practitioners/end-users, facilitated co-operation between different research projects and reduced burden of wasted research or lost results.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The underlying idea of this topic is to avoid that security and disaster risk research projects obtain and prepare data that at the end of the projects is simply lost instead of being stored and shared for reuse.</p><p>In the security domain, due to its specificities, the special categories of data involved or/and unique limitations, which may call for additional requirements, a consolidated, common research database is particularly desired. It is of utmost importance that security practitioners are provided with an increased interoperability and improved (cross-border) exchange of data thanks to harmonised data file formats across Europe, which would easily take into account technological evolutions, i.e., be adaptable in time. Such a lack of realistic, up-to-date and sufficient training and testing data for research purposes and consequently the need for a database, data repository or any other effective and useful tool(s) to gather, manage and store varying security research data, have been regularly raised by the projects working in the area of security. The same is true of data on disaster risk management where national or regional analysis and forecasting databases or national disaster risk assessments can be fragmented or sealed without reasonable open, sustainable access to the wider community.</p><p>As a follow up of the outcomes and results of the LAGO project coming from the 2021 data topic: HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-04: Improved access to fighting crime and terrorism research data, the successful proposal, should subsequently focus on creation and deployment of a fully functional and operational common research data repository, which will extend to cover other security research areas.</p><p>The LAGO project is currently developing the skeleton of how such a repository of R&amp;I data should be created, by providing a detailed roadmap consisting of a clear set of rules, conditions and characteristics that such a consolidated database should have. This LAGO roadmap will provide technical, legal and ethical requirements for a training and testing research data repository mostly in the area of fighting crime and terrorism, but the same project will already take into account possible applications of identified solutions in different security research domains, such as infrastructure resilience, border management or disaster resilience. The LAGO roadmap will also assess if the repository should be centralised or distributed, how to deal with \"aging\" data, how efficiently projects should exchange data among them taking into account security R&amp;I specificities.</p><p>Building on the skeleton of LAGO, the newly developed data repository will enable security community (researchers, practitioners, industry, policy makers) access the scientifically satisfactory amount of up-to-date high quality and realistic data which is or was used to develop reliable (mostly digital and based on AI but also non-digital and not linked with big data) tools, technologies and solutions in support of security research and innovation. This data repository could also be very useful for verification and validation of new innovative security solutions developed under various calls in the most recent Work Programme.</p><p>Taking into account the complexity of the future repository, a multi-faceted approach will be needed and the proposal, apart from the roadmap’s findings developed by LAGO, should also build on, and not duplicate, LAGO’s outcomes regarding the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>What exact types of data should be stored in the repository;</li><li>Interoperability with existing operational systems;</li><li>Interoperability/compatibility with European open science cloud (EOSC), with the TESSERA project<sup>[1]</sup> as well as other potentially relevant architectures and initiatives such as European Data Spaces or GAIA-X;</li><li>How to search for data;</li><li>Data models for security research - Harmonising of data formats;</li><li>Concept of operations for the use of the repository by/during EU-funded security R&amp;I projects, modalities of use, user profiles/schemes, etc.</li><li>Legal issues, avoidance of any bias, accessibility levels related to the sensitivity of various data sets, solutions for annotation as well as for the aging of the data, etc.</li> </ul><p>The proposal should carry out extensive testing and evaluation (verification and validation), in close cooperation with ongoing projects, which would access the repository, populate it and use data intensively during the project implementation.</p><p>The proposal should develop an exploitation and sustainability plan following up the planning activities of LAGO, including funding instruments to be used for the operationalisation of the repository developed under the project as well as finding possibilities to maintain the repository after the lifetime of the project so that it not only continues to well function but is able to be extended with new data. The data repository will need to grow so it will have to be treated as an ongoing system. Co-ordination with already existing platforms or communities already using another reliable domain-specific data repository/ies for archiving and sharing research data is strongly recommended in order to verify if it would be possible to adhere in the future to a larger system or infrastructure of repositories such as European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) for example and other relevant activities.</p><p>Adopting sound security practices, such as developing comprehensive access rules to allow only authorized users with a legitimate need to access, modify, or transmit data, are crucial. Combined with a digital signature approach or multi-factor authentication, access rules go a long way in keeping sensitive data stored in a data repository secure. These and other security measures, such as the anonymisation of personal data, will enable the research community to fully leverage large volumes of data without introducing unnecessary security risks.</p><p>The repository developed by the proposal should preserve research data relevant to various security research domains, such as fighting crime and terrorism, infrastructure resilience, border management or disaster resilience across time and help security research community easily find, access and re-use the necessary data. The development and the functioning of the repository will be based on the outcomes of the roadmap from the LAGO project<sup>[2]</sup> from 2021 FCT call project within the remits of Horizon Europe regulation (including ethics). The repository should be operational to be tested for at least one year before the project ends. Data sharing will be based on open science principle of ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable). To make data FAIR, the basics of good Research Data Management will have to be applied.</p><p>All necessary system features as well as the functioning of the repository should comply with privacy and data protection requirements when handling data, in order to facilitate data management ensuring full access to the data actually needed (in line with the necessity and proportionality principle and in full respect of fundamental rights and applicable legislation.</p><p>Projects should take into account, during their lifetime, relevant activities and initiatives for ensuring and improving the quality of scientific software and code, such as those resulting from projects funded under the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-02 on the development of community-based approaches.</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.</p><p>The project should have a maximum estimated duration of 3 years.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] TESSERA project: ‘Towards the datasets for the European Security Data Space for Innovation’.

These challenges and/or solutions should not be covered by topics of Horizon Europe Calls Fighting Crime and Terrorism 2023-2024. If they relate to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Fighting Crime and Terrorism 2021-2022, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them. The same applies regarding Horizon Europe projects under the calls HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-05: Evolution of political extremism, and HORIZON-CL2-2024-DEMOCRACY-01-05: Gender-roles in extremist movements.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address one of the following options:</p><p><strong>Option a</strong>: societal issues related to crime;</p><p><strong>Option b</strong>: societal issues related to terrorism and radicalisation.</p><p>Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should also convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects.</p><p>Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.</p><p>The proposals funded under this topic that concern issues which are within the mandate of Europol<sup>[1]</sup> are expected to engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the law enforcement community. Similarly, if the proposals concern drug-related issues, they are expected to engage with the EU Drugs Agency during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes.</p><p>If the funded proposal concerns radicalisation, the consortium is encouraged to liaise with the EU Knowledge Hub on prevention of radicalisation with the aim of facilitating the streamlining of their priorities and the dissemination of their results.</p><p>To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, i.e., Police Authorities and Non-Governmental Organisations / Civil Society Organisations, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project.</p><p>Activities proposed within this topic should address both technological and societal dimensions of the tackled challenge in a balanced way. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related innovation activities.</p><p>Proposals should plan their activities opting for the Financial Support to Third Parties in order to provide financial support to practitioners (Police Authorities and/or Non-Governmental Organisations/Civil Society Organisations) for expanding the proposed work in terms of additional user groups, complementary assessments, technology- or methodology-testing activities. From 5% up to 20% of the EU funding requested by the proposal may be allocated to the purpose of financial support to third parties.</p><p>Proposals must clearly describe the objectives and the expected results to be obtained, including the elements listed in the application template. Proposals are also expected to describe the methods and processes relevant to comply with the general eligibility conditions for financial support to third parties set out in General Annex B and to demonstrate effectiveness (impact).</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <u><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0794\">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0794</a></u><u> (Annex I)</u></p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>To offer advanced services on innovation uptake to the security community;</li><li>To provide a self-sustained mechanism for advanced advisory and support services, to act as a market catalyst; and to accelerate the uptake of innovation for security;</li><li>Enhanced cooperation between research institutions, smaller private research agencies, security practitioners, Start-ups and SMEs to support innovation uptake;</li><li>Strengthening the technology transfer from research to the market and strengthening of security ecosystem. Supporting Start-ups and SME to reach the security market and strengthen the capacity of security practitioners to uptake innovative tools from the security market. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The uptake of innovation stemming from EU-funded security research is not a single-step process, and there is no single method of ensuring the market uptake of successful research results. Innovation uptake needs to be contemplated as a long process that is conditioned by a number of enabling actions to be taken before research is even planned and long after it is completed. However, market uptake and deployment of innovation by security practitioners are recurrent challenges in civil security research.</p><p>The EU-funded security research ecosystem has changed the traditional relationship between practitioners and solution providers. The awareness of security needs and solutions has been steadily growing at all levels during the last years, with EU funded security research and innovation projects playing a pivotal role. This awareness guarantees not only that research addresses critical needs, but also that the research investment will deliver tangible results.</p><p>There are several approaches to achieve a better market uptake and to ensure that innovation can pass from the realm of research to the realm of the market and eventually innovative tools to be used by security practitioners.</p><p>In order to support SMEs and start-ups but also practitioners to find the avenues of uptake of innovation, models and methods for transferring research to the market should be promoted. This topic aims to offer services and guidance to entities in the security ecosystem to achieve market uptake.</p><p>The services should be delivered to SMEs/Start-ups and Practitioners. Therefore, there would be Supply-oriented Services and Demand-oriented services.</p><p>Some of the expected services could be open for the whole community (e.g., material online) and examples of good practices, whereas others would be provided upon specific request by an entity (on demand services). On demand services may be linked to other EU-funded actions but should not cover activities already funded from those in order to avoid double funding.</p><p>Applicants should be able to demonstrate a proven experience in technology development and innovation in the area of security and deep knowledge on the security ecosystem.</p><p>Successful candidates should be able to provide services such as:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Funding &amp; procurement guidance</li><li>Market research / competitive landscaping / Marketplaces / Market surveys/consultations</li><li>Proof of concept development (for TRL 2-4)</li><li>Funding and tendering observatory</li><li>Investor search / venture building</li><li>Technology validation support Lab testing support (i.e., Readiness assessment, Artificial Intelligence act compliance, Machine Learning security, Ethical Legal and Societal assessment, High Performance Computing capabilities, Synthetic data generation, Access to Datasets, stress testing etc.)</li><li>Tech and/or entrepreneurial skills development (training) </li> </ul><p>The proposals should outline the methods and processes by which they intend to decide which organisations they provide support to, respecting principles such as transparency, equal treatment, non-discrimination between organisations and effectiveness (impact). The project should provide suggestions for such methods and processes as deliverable to be approved by the European Commission. The applicants submitting the proposals have to ensure sufficient representativeness of the communities of interest (including, but not only, geographical representativeness) and a balanced coverage in terms of knowledge and skills of the different knowledge domains required to face the challenge, including security operations, technologies, research &amp; innovation, industry, market, etc. The applying consortia need to demonstrate that the project beneficiaries guarantee the expertise required to steer the project activities in all the knowledge domains to ensure the success of the action. The work of the partners has to be supported by solid and recognised tools and methods, also accompanied by the required expertise to put them in practice.</p><p>Proposals should take into account the work initiated by the Networks of Practitioners funded under H2020 Secure Societies work programmes and the ongoing work of Knowledge Networks. Proposals should build to the extent possible on the outcomes of previous initiatives that foster innovation uptake (e.g., iProcureNet<sup>[1]</sup> Multirate<sup>[2]</sup>, etc). In addition, existing initiatives like Horizon Booster<sup>[3]</sup> EACTDA<sup>[4]</sup> and EAFIP<sup>[5]</sup> have some components which could be used by the successful project and to be adapted in the area of security.</p><p>The project has to identify and describe options for the sustainability of the services beyond the project lifetime, including the setting up of a permanent scheme which will continue to offer the proposed services to the community as a self-sustainable mechanism.</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.</p><p>The project should have a maximum estimated duration of 5 years.</p><p>The provision of financial support to third parties in the form of grants is optional.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://www.iprocurenet.eu/\">https://www.iprocurenet.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <a href=\"https://www.multirate.eu/\">https://www.multirate.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <a href=\"https://www.horizonresultsbooster.eu/\">https://www.horizonresultsbooster.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <a href=\"https://www.eactda.eu/\">https://www.eactda.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <a href=\"https://eafip.eu/\">https://eafip.eu/</a></p>"

External border areas, pre-frontier areas as well as contexts and scenarios in Europe’s border regions that may in the future be impacted by geopolitical instabilities, hybrid threats, or tensions from outside the EU, and need sustained and improved surveillance and reaction capabilities, could be particularly considered. If they relate to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Effective Management of EU External Borders 2021-2022 or 2023-2024, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them.</p><p>Proposals may also address capabilities of information exchange, capabilities for detection of illegal activities, and/or solutions that can be deployed efficiently across diverse geographical regions; capabilities for operational event data recording; capabilities to detect irregular activities in areas of terminals for travel (air, sea) or logistics terminals around a Border Control Point, without disrupting the flow of operations; capabilities that support and help the decision-making process and facilitate operating in different scenarios (air, sea, land) simultaneously.</p><p>The EBCG Capability Roadmap recognises that future surveillance capabilities that help detect cross-border irregularities and cases requiring Search and Rescue activities are essential. Solutions should be modular and scalable to cater to the regional and challenges specificities.</p><p>Examples of technologies and solutions that may be relevant for this topic include but are not limited to: sensing (at tactical, operational, and/or strategic levels), autonomous platforms, vehicles and systems (aerial, ground, surface or underwater, vessel-based or not, mobile or land-borne, etc); interconnectivity between sensors and platforms and automated data fusion; data processing systems; image and signal processing and analysis; robotics; computing technologies including edge and cloud computing; decision-support systems and human-machine interfaces.</p><p>Projects should integrate:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>perspectives of safeguarding and promoting human rights, including gender equality, developing solutions that contribute to those safeguarding and promotion;</li><li>inputs from human rights, law and ethical perspectives, as well as the consideration and views of individuals and society, as well as a gender sensitive approach, as appropriate; proposals can engage with civil society organisations for wider input and support;</li><li>aspects of cybersecurity of the technology proposed, and the protection of communication systems and networks involved in the solutions, if and as relevant.</li> </ul><p>Proposals that include solutions and/or methods that would contribute to a lower environmental impact and footprint, better cost-efficiency, better energy-efficiency, and/or better operational autonomy of the capabilities and solutions in this topic, would be welcome.</p><p>Depending on the particular scope of the proposal, participation of Police and/or Customs Authorities is welcome.</p><p>To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project.</p><p>In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to one or both of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Improved disaster preparedness, learning from past disasters or crises, and better sharing of knowledge on lessons learned and risk awareness to citizens and regional and/or local authorities, understanding what countermeasures were taken in previous incidents and exploring currently available products to improve future outcomes;</li><li>Reinforced dialogue and cooperation among scientific and technical communities, stakeholders, policy-makers and regional and/or local communities in disaster risk reduction for an enhanced uptake of research outputs. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Societal resilience and preparedness to disasters are shaped by the way authorities and citizens exchange, access, understand, and react to information about hazards. As a result, anyone may become more vulnerable if barriers to these processes occur. Strengthening societal resilience to disasters, therefore, requires investment by authorities at operational, strategic, and policy levels to improve engagement with citizens and integrate inclusive communication processes. In order to achieve this, it is important to take into account the diversity of citizens, be it relating to age, gender, educational levels, disability, and other social characteristics.</p><p>The European Commission is developing and implementing an EU Preparedness Union Strategy following whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. The EU’s disaster resilience goal No. 2 is “Prepare – Increasing risk awareness and preparedness of the population<sup>[1]</sup>. The proposals’ outcomes should especially work towards supporting these two policies and follow the recommendations of the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) to ensure a successful uptake to the end users. Proposals are invited to utilise the Special Eurobarometer on “Disaster risk awareness and preparedness of the EU population<sup>[2]</sup>\" as evidence of needs.</p><p>Under the open topic, proposals are welcome to address new, upcoming or unforeseen challenges and/or creative or disruptive solutions and technology, including the use of AI, for improving disaster preparedness, risk awareness by citizens and regional and/or local authorities, and for reinforcing the cooperation among scientific / technical communities and policy-makers / regional and/or local authorities for an enhanced sharing of knowledge and uptake of research outputs. If they relate to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Disaster-Resilient Society 2021-2022 or 2023-2024, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address one of the following options:</p><p><strong>Option a</strong>: Tools and solutions to improve disaster preparedness and risk awareness by citizens and regional and/or local authorities;</p><p><strong>Option b</strong>: Mechanism to enhance dialogue among research/academic communities, practitioners and regional and/or local authorities for sharing knowledge and effectively uptake research results.</p><p>Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.</p><p>Proposals funded under this topic are expected to engage with citizen organisations, regional and/or local authorities and practitioners (first and second responders/civil protection agencies/disaster management authorities), private sector operators during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the Disaster Risk Reduction community.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of related research and innovation activities.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] (2023/C 56/01); COM (2023) 61 final.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <a href=\"https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/3228\">https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/3228</a></p>"

Proposals should primarily address sector(s) and/or interdependencies that are not covered, in particular by the past Horizon Europe calls: Resilient Infrastructure 2023 and Resilient Infrastructure 2024. If they relate to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Resilient Infrastructure 2021-2022, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on their outcomes and not duplicate them.</p><p>Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed activities, proposals should convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstrations, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Proposals should also outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at regional, national and/or EU level.</p><p>To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment, performed by the practitioners involved in the project, of the project’s mid-term outcomes.</p><p>In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.</p><p>Proposals should plan their activities opting for the financial support to third parties in order to provide financial support to practitioners (critical infrastructure operator, government authority responsible for infrastructure resilience, national authority responsible for overseeing critical infrastructure operators, or civil protection authority) for expanding the proposed work in terms of additional user groups, complementary assessments, technology- or methodology-testing activities and/or to SMEs as additional solution providers. From 10% up to 30% of the EU funding requested by the proposal may be allocated to the purpose of financial support to third parties.</p><p>Proposals must clearly describe the objectives and the expected results to be obtained, including the elements listed in the application template. Proposals are also expected to describe the methods and processes relevant to comply with the general eligibility conditions for financial support to third parties set out in General Annex B and to demonstrate effectiveness (impact).</p><p>Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication, exploit complementarities, and use opportunities for increased impact. Similarly, coordination with projects funded under HORIZON-CL3-2025-INFRA-01-02: Open topic for role of the human factor for resilience of European critical entities.</p>"

Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects.</p><p>Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. For Option b), the active involvement, as beneficiaries, of forensic institutes from EU Member States or Associated Countries is recommended.</p><p>The proposals funded under this topic that concern issues which are within the mandate of Europol<sup>[1]</sup> are expected to engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the law enforcement community. Similarly, if the proposals concern drug-related issues, they are expected to engage with the EU Drugs Agency during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes.</p><p>In order to ensure project impact and the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, i.e., Police Authorities and/or forensic institutes, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project.</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <u><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0794\">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0794</a></u><u> (Annex I)</u></p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development of a mature technological solution addressing EU security policy priorities in the areas addressed by the Cluster 3 work programme and in particular the destination of fighting crime and terrorism, disaster resilient societies, border management and resilient infrastructure.</li><li>Facilitated access to civil security market for small innovators;</li><li>Improved cooperation between public buyers and small supply market actors for a swifter uptake of innovation in response to short to mid-term needs;</li><li>Stronger partnerships between small and medium EU security industry and technology actors to ensure the sustainability of the EU innovation capacity in the civil security domain and reduce technological dependencies from non-EU suppliers in critical security areas. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Europe’s 25 million small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU economy. SMEs can bring innovation to societal challenges, including the security of EU citizens. Innovative SMEs and high-tech start-ups can transform and modernise EU security capabilities.</p><p>However, despite the innovation capacity of EU SMEs, these often experience difficulties in finding their way to the public markets. These include red tape in public contracts, access to</p><p>new customers, access to finance, industrial competition and IP valorisation. These difficulties are exacerbated in markets that show restrictions of different kind, as it is the case of security.</p><p>Knowing that SMEs require additional support to reach the security buyers and that the collaboration opportunities offered by the projects of the Pillar II of Horizon Europe can be a catalyst for uptake, this topic aims to offer a collaborative environment for small and medium innovators to tailor their innovations to the specific needs of civil security end-users.</p><p>Applicants are invited to submit proposals for technology development along with the following principles:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Focus on mature digital technological solutions aligned with STEP guidance<sup>[1]</sup> addressing EU security policy priorities in the areas addressed by the Cluster 3 Work Programme;</li><li>Fostering collaboration between SMEs from different Member States and Associated Countries;</li><li>Involving security end-users in the role of validator and potential first-adopter of the proposed innovations;</li><li>Fostering collaboration schemes between small companies and research and technology organisations and/or big industrial players aimed at fostering innovative technology transfer or creating innovative business models that facilitate access to market and strengthen the innovation capacity of EU SMEs and start-ups in the domain of civil security. </li> </ul><p>Examples of activities to plan in the proposed projects include, but are not limited to: assimilating market requirements; facilitating access to additional funding; approaching potential public buyers; assess competitive landscape; supporting in innovation management (methodological and process innovation, business model innovation, market innovation); assist in IP management and exploitation; provide guidance for expansion to future markets, etc.</p><p>The participation of research and technology organisations should not focus on own technology development but on supporting the small industrial players in accelerating the technology transfer of innovative security solutions for their further development and production.</p><p>It is encouraged that one SME takes the coordinator role<sup>[2]</sup>. Exceptions to this requirement should be duly justified.</p><p>The projects should have a maximum estimated duration of 2 years.</p><p>This topic contributes to the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP<sup>[3]</sup>) and addresses civil security technologies falling under the sectors of “Digital technologies and deep-tech innovation<sup>[4]</sup>. This topic contributes to the objectives stated in the STEP Regulation, i.e., to boost investment in critical technologies in Europe, and, to contribute to reducing or preventing the strategic dependencies of the Union.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] For more information on STEP guidance - see the <a href=\"https://strategic-technologies.europa.eu/document/download/e204ce9e-0407-4f03-82f8-6f518ce12886_en?filename=C_2024_3148_F1_COMMUNICATION_FROM_COMMISSION_EN_V6_P1_3408774.PDF\">Guidance Note concerning certain provisions of Regulation (EU) 2024/795 establishing the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP)</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] If a MIDCAP is included in the proposal, it could also take the role of coordinator.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] OJ L, 2024/795, 29.2.2024, ELI: <a href=\"http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/795/oj\">http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/795/oj</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <a href=\"https://strategic-technologies.europa.eu/index_en\">https://strategic-technologies.europa.eu/index_en</a></p>"

Contexts and scenarios in Europe’s border regions that may in the future be impacted by geopolitical instabilities or tensions from outside the EU, and need sustained and improved surveillance and reaction capabilities, could be particularly considered. Moreover, mechanisms for detecting the presence of threats in travel flows should be investigated. If they relate to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Effective Management of EU External Borders 2021-2022 or 2023-2024, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them.</p><p>Proposals may also address capabilities related to possible future digitalised travel credentials (DTC), including though not limited to: Type-1 and Type-2 and forward integration with secure digital citizenship wallet(s); identification and verification in the context of border checks; optimisation of resources in the context of border checks.</p><p>According to the European Border and Coast Guard (EBCG) Capability Roadmap, legal border crossings should be as swift and simple as possible, preferably fully automated. Border Crossing Points should also have the ability to detect any unauthorised crossings of persons or goods.</p><p>Examples of technologies and solutions that may be relevant for this topic include but are not limited to: secure and private data approaches for applications in border checks; fuzzy searches capabilities; data communication, translation and sharing solutions; biometrics; age assessment methods; fraudulent documents detection; automation, exchange and interoperability for systems involved in border checks.</p><p>Projects should integrate aspects of:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>perspectives of safeguarding and promoting human rights, developing solutions that contribute to those safeguarding and promotion;</li><li>inputs from human rights, law and ethical perspectives, as well as the consideration and views of individuals and society and the societal dimension, including a gender sensitive approach, as appropriate; proposals can engage with citizens and civil society for wider input and support;</li><li>aspects of cybersecurity of the technology proposed, and the protection of communication systems and networks involved in the solutions, if and as relevant.</li> </ul><p>Proposals that include solutions and/or methods that would contribute to a lower environmental impact and footprint, better cost-efficiency, better energy-efficiency, and/or better operational autonomy of the capabilities and solutions in this topic, would be welcome.</p><p>Depending on the particular scope of the proposal, participation of Police and/or Customs Authorities is welcome.</p><p>To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project.</p>"

They provide information and on-the ground advice to potential applicants and beneficiaries, through the project life cycle, in their own language, in a manner that would be impossible for the European Commission and its Agencies acting alone.</p><p>NCPs can benefit in their work from the sharing of best practices among them. NCPs can also help to give visibility to different perspectives of all Security Research and Innovation (R&amp;I) stakeholders and to break geographical silos by aggregating the knowledge existing in the EU Member States and regions and incorporate it to the European picture. This set-up increases the visibility of the security at EU level and across security areas.</p><p>However, the security sector exhibits a remarkable geographic fragmentation, with actors operating at EU level, at national level, at regional level and even at local level. In order to acknowledge the different perspectives of all stakeholders and break geographical silos, there is a need to aggregate the knowledge existing in the Member States and Associated countries and incorporate it to the European picture.</p><p>Cooperation with national stakeholders and establishment of stronger links with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS)<sup>[2]</sup>.</p><p>These links should help to have a more comprehensive view of the common EU security needs and solutions, to better capitalise on pan-European cooperation and funding opportunities, and to give visibility to results from EU and other research projects.</p><p>Proposals should link NCPs with national communities for research and innovation that exist already or will be established. The idea of this link is to identify capability gaps, solutions to address those gaps, and research needs at local, regional and national level and integrate them in the EU picture in collaboration with CERIS.</p><p>In addition, this collaboration will assist NCPs to share research opportunities coming from national research programmes and initiatives with the wider security research community at national level. This will also improve the visibility of the results achieved by national players following their participation in research projects (national or EU-funded), and in particular those which have led to the deployment of solutions in the field of operations, or which have a strong potential for uptake as a result of the interest expressed by national buyers.</p><p>Finally, this will support the promotion of innovation uptake with financial pathways and opportunities to enable the uptake of innovative solutions stemming from EU, national or regional capacity building funds, with special emphasis on the EU Home Affairs funds (both in the parts under shared management and those under direct management by the Commission) and on the European Regional Development Fund.</p><p>As an output of the action, the beneficiaries should develop a model for the cooperation and enlargement of with the national research and innovation communities beyond the lifetime of the project and independent of EU security research funding. The objective is to support the establishment of self-standing national communities beyond the duration of the project.</p><p>The successful proposal will contribute to delivering the Programme’s objectives and impacts and raise awareness of potential applicants for calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 3 – \"Civil Security for Society\". Irrespectively of their sector or discipline, project proposals should aim to facilitate trans-national co-operation between NCPs, with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to Programme applicants. The project should also allow for a better flow of information relevant for the implementation of the Programme from the EU level to the national level and vice-versa, and also across Member States and Associated Countries. This includes fostering the participation of national players in EU security research and innovation fora. Particular attention should be given to results that have led to the deployment of solutions in the field of operations, or that show a strong potential for uptake because of the interest expressed by national buyers.</p><p>Proposals should link up potential participants from widening countries with emerging consortia in the domain of the Cluster “Civil Security for Society” building on previous initiatives from similar past projects. Matchmaking should take place by means of online tools, brokerage events, info days and bilateral meetings between project initiators and candidate participants from widening countries. Other matchmaking instruments may be used as appropriate. The project proposal to be funded should cover a wide range of activities related to Horizon Europe, address issues specific to the Cluster \"Civil Security for Society\" and may follow up on the work of SEREN5.</p><p>The network should organise matchmaking activities in accordance with Annex IV of the NCP Minimum Standards and Guiding Principles. Proposals should also take into account support activities for coordination between the respective beneficiary (NCP) and the respective National Coordination Centre<sup>[4]</sup> within the relevant Member States as applicable once the regulation mentioned above is in force.</p><p>The project consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.</p><p>The recommended duration of the project is 3 years.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <u><a href=\"https://horizoneuropencpportal.eu/\">https://horizoneuropencpportal.eu/</a></u></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/networks/ceris-community-european-research-and-innovation-security_en</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/networks/ceris-community-european-research-and-innovation-security_en</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] National Coordination Centres according to regulation (EU) 2021/887 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2021.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Increased exploitation of novel materials, design methods, and control techniques for soft robotics, enabling the creation of inherently safe and versatile robotic systems with applications in various industries, including healthcare, maintenance, manufacturing, and transportation.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Soft robotics<sup>[1]</sup> represents an important avenue to advance robotics, particularly for enhancing safety and physical interaction. Its potential lies in creating systems with intrinsic and functional safety, capable of securely interacting with humans across various scenarios. By using compliant designs, these systems overcome the limitations of rigid robotic systems, such as limited adaptability and reduced safety around humans. Novel design methods, the use of smart materials, deformable physical architectures, and bioinspired approaches are key to improving robotic performance. However, significant challenges remain in learning, modelling, simulation, control, actuation, sensing, and the integration of soft electronics.</p><p>To address this, proposals should focus on exploiting novel materials and design methods for non-rigid structures, along with advanced control techniques for soft robotic systems.</p><p>Proposals should cover one or more of the following areas:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Exploitation of novel materials suited to developing robotic systems, both as the main structure and of manipulators and end effectors. These may encompass passive and active materials, and combination materials with specific properties.</li><li>Design methods for non-rigid structures and the means to accurate and sense position where this may no longer involve fixed rotational or linear links</li><li>Control methods for structures built from novel and soft materials or for structures that emulate rigid structures using soft materials.</li> </ul><p>The proposals should include at least three different demonstrators from different sectors that clearly show the advantage of soft robotics in the context of some chosen application scenarios. The objective is to develop and disseminate general purpose tools and systems, therefore the results should not be limited to the demonstration scenarios selected in the proposals to demonstrate the technological progress.</p><p>All proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&amp;D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA.</p><p>Proposals should also build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national or regional initiatives.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] soft robotics concerns the design, control, and fabrication of robots composed of compliant materials, instead of rigid links. Hence such robots can be composed of rigid parts linked by compliant links</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes: </p><ul level=\"0\"><li>New assessment and validations methodologies developed allowing to evaluate General Purpose AI (GPAI) models, including multimodal systems, and systems’ capabilities and risks.</li><li>Use of the research outcomes by GPAI providers, policymakers, public institutions, and other relevant stakeholders to evaluate GPAI models and systems’ capabilities and risks.</li><li>Support to the AI Office in its function to conduct evaluations of general purpose AI models with a view to enforce the AI Act' rules for general purpose AI models and facilitate self-evaluation for GPAI model developers to ensure compliance with AI Act requirements.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the development of increasingly sophisticated general-purpose AI (GPAI) models and systems. These models, such as large language models and multimodal AI systems, demonstrate remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, assessing the capabilities of these models remains a significant challenge. Traditional evaluation methods often fail to capture the full spectrum of abilities exhibited by GPAI models and systems. Therefore, there is a pressing need for the development of <strong><em>new assessment frameworks, methodologies and tools</em></strong> that can comprehensively evaluate these models in terms of their trustworthy and ethical behaviour and operation, ensuring their reliability, fairness, and alignment with human values.</p><p>This topic aims to develop robust assessment tools, techniques, and benchmarks specifically designed to rigorously evaluate GPAI models and systems, including multimodal systems. Proposals should cover one or more of the following research areas:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Innovative methods for proactively identifying and forecasting emergent capabilities in GPAI models and systems. This encompasses the identification of capabilities with both beneficial and potentially detrimental uses.</li><li>Assessment of GPAI capabilities with a significant economic impact or potential for misuse. This includes assessing capabilities that drive beneficial innovation and societal good, as well as evaluating potential risks in areas such as chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) hazards or cybersecurity threats.</li><li>Developing assessment techniques that illuminate the underlying mechanisms of emergent capabilities in AI systems, emphasising interpretability and explainability.</li> </ul><p>Projects should generate example benchmark tests to examine trained AI models, systematically uncovering latent capabilities. These benchmarks will be made available to GPAI providers, policymakers, and other relevant stakeholders to implement robust evaluation tools.</p><p>This topic strongly encourages the formation of interdisciplinary teams combining the necessary technical expertise. Such a collaborative approach will ensure that assessments accurately capture real-world use cases, including capabilities elicitation techniques, and that the developed frameworks, methodologies and tools are responsive to the concerns of all relevant stakeholders.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>Proposals must adhere to Horizon Europe's requirements regarding Open Science. Open access to research outputs should be provided unless there is a legitimate reason or constraint; in such cases, the proposal should detail how GPAI providers, policymakers, and other stakeholders will access the research outcomes.</p><p>All proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. This should include participation in international evaluation contests and the presentation of illustrative application use-cases that demonstrate concrete potential added value. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&amp;D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.</p><p>Proposals should also build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national or regional initiatives. Regarding European programmes, projects are expected to develop synergies and complementarities with relevant projects funded under Horizon Europe but also under the Digital Europe Programme (DEP).</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><ul level=\"0\"><li>Improved methods and tools to optimally develop and deliver bias-free AI algorithms and generative AI.</li><li>New concepts of the auto-evolution-enabled software elements that AI algorithms can autonomously select and integrate.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The latest developments in AI are demanding computation infrastructures designed to maximize the number of FLOPS. Europe has a window of opportunity to leverage open source and ensure that the European industry is at the cutting edge of these new processing infrastructures. The current methods and tools to develop and efficiently deliver AI pipelines and complex generative AI applications present several shortcomings.</p><p>Current identified challenges include the continuous management of data pipelines, novel testing methods (e.g. differential testing or improved performance testing), optimized deployment strategies (in terms of using energy efficient resources or the best performant), management of dependencies with a diverse set of types of hardware, algorithm bias and discrimination against certain groups, determined by characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, age or disability, as well as the maintenance of the effectiveness of AI applications, notably generative AI ones. The explainability of AI models is another crucial challenge that must be also tackled at the software engineering level, possibly in synergy with explainability methods at the machine learning stage. Also, large language models and foundational models require the development and operation of complex system architectures that need to handle data processing at large scale, continuous training of models and inference. Furthermore, AI pipelines and generative AI application also strongly suffer from poor protection against learning dataset poisoning, as well as prompt poisoning; software engineering methods and tools providing support to protect against those attacks are thus direly required. This presents novel challenges for developers that will need to be addressed with the development of new methods, mechanisms and tools covering the above, including neuromorphic computing, but not limited to.</p><p>The main objectives for the advancements of Software Engineering in this field are:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increasing the productivity of generative AI application developers, and operators, especially of foundational and language models.</li><li>Define a reference architecture and framework for generative AI application developers to simplify integration and system modularity.</li><li>Simplifying and automating the development and operation of such applications.</li><li>Including novel techniques for the generation of labelled training sets for reinforcement learning (RL) from human feedback, to be evaluated with corresponding RL algorithms.</li><li>Facilitating AI progress and advancement beyond the state-of-the-art in the EU at a faster rate vis-à-vis the rest of the world and contributing to the implementation of the AI Act.</li><li>Establishing collaboration with EU-based chips designers to maximize how the hardware resources are fully optimized with the software to develop</li> </ul><p>The proposal should address at least one use case as an industry application (e.g., automotive, health, energy, food/agriculture, etc.).</p><p>Actions could build on, provide support or seek collaboration with existing projects, develop synergies and ensure complementarities with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives currently demanding this kind of optimisations possibly in different verticals: e.g. digital twins leveraging GenAI, data quality enhancement leveraging GenAI, development of energy-efficient AI algorithms.</p><p>Communicable results should be shared with the European R&amp;D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA, and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.</p><p>Actions are encouraged to build on, provide support or seek collaboration with existing projects, develop synergies and ensure complementarities with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives currently demanding this kind of optimisations possibly in different verticals: e.g. digital twins leveraging GenAI, data quality enhancement leveraging GenAI, development of energy-efficient AI algorithms.

The state-of-the-art in generative AI and large language models is heavily reliant on high-performance processing and very large AI models. Cutting-edge hardware accelerators that power these processing systems are scarce on the market and only available in highly specialised, high-performance infrastructures in certain cloud and HPC environments at considerable costs. At the same time, the requirement to gather, process, and transmit massive amounts of data to the central data processing environment remains a barrier for many AI applications. All these factors urge the emergence of efficient tools and mechanisms <strong>to empower the distribution of AI training and inference processes throughout the computing continuum.</strong></p><p>Empowering the next generation AI technologies with on-demand, agile and situation-aware infrastructure that brings data- and computing power to where and when it is needed will let end-users exploit Artificial Intelligence across the computing continuum without compromising on security and trust and optimising their energy use. These <strong>challenges</strong> span various aspects of the continuum, including <strong>on-device data processing, data orchestration and sharing, AI integration, decentralised intelligent management, decentralized and global optimization, energy and resource heterogeneity support, data management, security/privacy, and synergies with 5G/6G.</strong> Addressing these challenges is crucial for realizing the vision of a cognitive cloud-to-edge continuum as a key enabler for any emerging trends such as AI/generative AI.</p><p>The Cognitive Computing Continuum could eventually be extended to i<strong>nclude other computational resources</strong>, such as <strong>HPC</strong>, and provide abstraction layers to maximize the benefits of available hardware.</p><p>Addressing all the above complexities calls for innovative research to overcome these challenges. <strong>The aim is to develop generic and AI-enabled cloud-edge technologies encompassing the whole computing continuum to empower the development of AI/generative AI technologies and applications.</strong> The proposals should demonstrate the generic applicability of the proposed technological solutions across various application domains such as but not limited to, manufacturing, healthcare, robotics, transportation and smart cities.</p><p>The following (one or more) research areas should be addressed:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>Development of novel mechanisms for the efficient development, deployment, and operation of AI workflows</strong> across heterogeneous and distributed infrastructures along the Edge to Cloud to HPC continuum that optimise training times, model accuracy and data management while factoring in performance metrics such as memory usage, energy efficiency, application processing and data transfer latency, and network overheads. These should factor in virtualisation and orchestration techniques that seamlessly integrate heterogeneous processor architectures and cater for the explainability of the applied cognitive optimisations.</li><li><strong>Decentralised and federated computing continuum tools and mechanisms to enable distributed AI architectures.</strong> These include scheduling, orchestration, and placement mechanisms that leverage the wide range of Edge computing environments available in the compute continuum, including on-device edge. Tools and mechanisms should take into consideration - where appropriate - data security and privacy aspects. The focus is on enhancing AI process execution through techniques such as model, data, hybrid parallelism and data compression, gossip, swarm, and federated training, or conditional computing.</li><li><strong>Cloud and edge processing</strong> <strong>tools and techniques to reduce AI processing power usage and emissions across the cognitive computing continuum</strong>, relying on hardware efficiency (for example, thanks to special-purpose accelerators and heterogeneous hardware processor architectures) and energy optimisation techniques, such as hardware and software approximation.</li> </ul><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, Data, and Robotics.</p><p>Projects are expected to develop synergies and relate to activities and outcomes of the Digital Europe Programme (DEP) and any existing or emerging Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) initiative, such as IPCEI-CIS.</p><p>All proposals are expected to share communicable results with the European R&amp;D community, through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary other relevant digital resource platforms in order to enhance the European AI, Data and Robotics ecosystem through the sharing of results and best practice.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Photonic sensor technologies enable precision and versatility in sensing across multiple domains. The integration into multimodal systems enhances data accuracy, speed and reliability. Advancements in photonic sensors and their multimodal integration aim to elevate diagnostics, monitoring, and sensing by improving efficiency, performance, and reliability while reducing size and manufacturing costs and power consumption.</p><p>The development of sensor technologies and multimodal integration is closely aligned with several key EU policies. These include achieving open strategic autonomy in digital and emerging enabling technologies, enhancing Europe's technological sovereignty, and supporting the twin transition to a digital and green economy by promoting energy-efficient, competitive, and resilient digital infrastructures.</p><p>The initiative also aims to advance the digital transformation by providing access to high-quality environmental data, supporting the development of technologies for privacy, compliance, and data integrity to empower decision-making and foster a fair data economy.</p><p>Lastly, it contributes to the green transition by leveraging photonic sensor technologies for environmental monitoring and sustainable practices. It aligns with the EU's objectives for a green and digital economy, enhancing system operations and promoting innovation in eco-friendly practices, thus strengthening Europe's technological leadership for societal and economic progress.</p><p>Projects are expected to contribute to at least three of the following outcomes to fully exploit the potential of photonics for a digital, green and healthy future in Europe:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increase the efficiency of developed photonic sensors, surpassing existing technologies in aspects such as energy consumption, data acquisition and processing speed, as well as measurement accuracy.</li><li>Significantly reduce the size, weight, or footprint of the sensors and quantify advancements over current technologies.</li><li>Improve both intrinsic and extrinsic performance metrics to boost measurement accuracy for at least three use-case scenarios.</li><li>Extend the sensing and testing capabilities of photonic sensors by linking optical with non-optical measurement parameters (e.g. for acoustic sensing or electromagnetic sensing).</li><li>Contribute to reducing manufacturing costs and increasing resource-efficiency, while also enhancing reliability and durability of the targeted sensor systems.</li> </ul><p>They are additionally expected to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Help secure the open strategic autonomy for Europe by ensuring intellectual property and production means of key technologies are maintained within the EU, reducing dependencies and enhancing negotiation power in technological cooperation.</li><li>Help maximise international competitiveness by increasing the uptake and translation of photonic technologies into new products and services, guided by key technology requirements.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The scope of this topic focuses on the advancement and application of photonic sensor technologies and their integration into multimodal systems. Proposals are expected to address the development of sensor technologies and their validation through trials in realistic use cases. This includes exploring multi-modal sensor capabilities, as well as employing sensor fusion and machine learning approaches for the analysis of sensor data. Techniques should address at least two different technology approaches, i.e. sensor modalities, of which at least one must be photonic from the following areas:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>3D sensing and imaging such as LIDAR, optical coherence tomography (OCT), optical tomography, interferometry, photoacoustics, etc.</li><li>Communication fiber sensing</li><li>Chemical and gas sensing   </li><li>Bio- and medical sensing and/or imaging  </li><li>Particle sensing   </li><li>Integrated photonic solutions</li> </ul><p>In addition, the proposals could focus on developing and integrating algorithms designed to enhance the processing capabilities and decision-making accuracy of photonic sensors. These algorithms may help to optimize the interpretation of complex sensor data, enable real-time analytics, ambient intelligence and adaptive responses in dynamic environments.</p><p>Furthermore, projects should aim to provide significant improvements in one or more of the application domains listed below and to demonstrate these in at least three use case scenarios. Demonstrators would be expected to reach TRL 4-5 while the photonic techniques would be developed up to TRL 7.</p><p>This expectation underlines the call's objective to foster innovations that have a substantial and beneficial impact on society and various industry sectors:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Healthcare (medical diagnostics, disinfection, treatment through improved imaging techniques and diagnostic accuracy).</li><li>Transportation Safety (enhanced safety features in automotive and aerospace industries through better sensing capabilities).</li><li>Industrial efficiency and sustainability (industrial processes such as manufacturing, quality control, increasing precision and automation through improved sensing technologies).</li><li>Agricultural/Food Sector (precision agriculture, food safety, food waste reduction and supply chain management through improved sensing techniques for monitoring crop health, detecting contaminants, and optimizing production processes and raw material utilisation).</li><li>Environmental Monitoring and sustainable energy (pollution monitoring, climate research, renewable energy infrastructure and natural disaster mitigation).</li><li>Security, safety and resilience of people and critical infrastructure (face identification, long distance observation by day and night, (infra-)structural health monitoring, chemical and gas sensing, explosive detection)</li><li>Protection and efficient operation of optical communications, risk management of data transport and processing including increased resilience to cyber security.</li> </ul><p>Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business scenario and exploitation strategy.</p><p>Research must build on existing standards or contribute to standardisation. Where relevant, interoperability for data sharing should be addressed.</p><p>All projects should build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms, in particular the Digital Europe Programme (DEP).</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>African societies benefit from innovative solutions on GenAI applied to key areas:</li><li>Local technological companies in some locations in Africa benefit from the technological capacity to develop targeted solutions to unlock the full potential of GenAI Digital in key areas with the primary focus on rural communities in Africa and women, being an underrepresented group but with a key role in the foundation of these societies.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Generative AI (GenAI) holds the potential of creating in Africa a rich ecosystem of transformative solutions and practical applications addressing the specific societal challenges and opportunities most of the countries are facing.</p><p>The proposals should address one or more of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Agriculture optimisation: GenAI can analyse satellite imagery and sensor data to monitor state of crops, soil conditions, and weather patterns, enabling farmers to boost crop yields and enhance food security through sophisticated predictive analytics and efficient resource management like water and pesticides. This is crucial to mitigate climate change and poor irrigation infrastructures in some areas of Africa.</li><li>Healthcare: GenAI can diagnose diseases from medical images and patient data, enhancing healthcare in remote areas; forecast disease outbreaks and aid in preventive planning, and with the help of chatbots and virtual assistants can offer medical advice and connect patients with doctors, expanding telemedicine services, making healthcare more accessible to remote populations. Particular attention should be paid to the gender dimension in addressing AI biases, sex-specific healthcare needs, and intersecting gender and racial inequalities in health and access to health services.</li><li>Infrastructure and urban planning: GenAI optimises energy usage, integrates renewables, and ensures efficient distribution, while managing water (including groundwater but also rainfall use) and waste (e.g. plastic reduction and reuse) effectively for sustainability, and enhancing safety with real-time incident detection. It also provides support for reconstruction following natural or human-made disasters. This is vital for some African communities with scarce natural resources like water and facing high temperatures by using Digital Twins on urban and rural areas. All these technological solutions depend strongly on the existence and quality of connectivity infrastructure, as a key enabler for unlocking the Digital and Green Transition.</li><li>Digital Skills and learning: Generative AI can personalize learning paths, create multilingual educational content, and offer on-demand virtual tutoring, benefiting rural communities with low resources and fully relying on mobile phones to access online services. Additionally, adaptive learning platforms can use data analytics to tailor teaching, while engineers craft queries to help AI models understand local languages and nuances to set up conversational chatbots for local communities.</li> </ul><p>The proposals should approach these objectives by:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Conducting an evidence-based analysis to identify particular needs in Africa that GenAI technologies could solve, for one or several of the topics mentioned above.</li><li>Identifying solutions on GenAI developed in the EU that could be applied in Africa for one or several of the topics mentioned above.</li><li>Based on existing EU-based solutions and particular needs, developing and integrating generative Artificial Intelligence models and algorithms specifically adapted for one or several of the abovementioned key areas.</li><li>Involving and supporting start-ups and local networks in 3 to 5 locations in Africa to create innovative solutions to uniquely African challenges in those areas based on GenAI. Co-creation and living lab methodologies should be explored to boost social uptake of proposed solutions. Living labs are ecosystems of experimentation and open innovation, with a systematic approach to co-creation among their users, whether they are researchers, businesses, civil society or public administrations. These open innovation spaces will enable researchers and local actors from the public and private sectors work together using digital technologies to co-create knowledge and solutions that respond to their societal needs, while improving territorial cohesion.</li><li>The approved projects should take into account the AI Act and GDPR as the main legal frameworks to ensure data protection of the data used within third countries.</li> </ul><p>Where relevant proposals are encouraged to build on, or seek collaboration with, existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European initiatives. In particular links are encouraged with the projects funded under international cooperation on AI for public good, in the areas of health, digital twin for reconstruction, emergency response and electric grid optimisation, Destination Earth, Copernicus.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models and architectures demonstrating enhanced capabilities, such as formal reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, confidence level estimation, long-term planning, and seamless adaptation to dynamic and non-stationary environments.</li><li>Innovative learning approaches combining self-supervised learning with hybrid learning, active learning, reinforcement learning, transfer learning, relational learning or continual learning and evolutionary learning.</li><li>Theoretical insights to advance the understanding of synergies between self-supervised and complementary learning paradigms in GPAI model development.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Current large-scale AI models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities that have transformed numerous fields. They excel at tasks like natural language processing, image generation, and playing complex games. However, despite these successes, current models often struggle in several key areas. They lack the adaptability to seamlessly adjust to changing conditions in real-world environments. Additionally, their reasoning abilities remain limited, when facing complex tasks that require logical deduction, mathematical problem-solving, or multi-step planning. Moreover, current GPAI models frequently fail to recognise their own limitations, leading them to generate erroneous outputs when presented with queries outside their domains of knowledge. These limitations underscore the need for advancements in General Purpose AI (GPAI) that go beyond pattern recognition and towards robust, adaptive systems capable of a wider range of intelligent behaviours, for example, taking inspirations from biological and collective systems.</p><p>To push the boundaries of current AI technology, this topic seeks the development of groundbreaking GPAI models that combine self-supervised learning with complementary learning strategies. These strategies include hybrid learning, which integrates symbolic reasoning and knowledge representation; active learning, which allows models to actively seek information to improve their performance; reinforcement learning, which enables models to learn through interaction with their environment; relational learning, which focuses on learning from relational data structures; continual learning, which allows models to continuously adapt and acquire new knowledge without forgetting previous tasks; and evolutionary learning, which draws inspiration from biological evolution to optimize model architectures and parameters; and physics-based learning, which considers physical properties in the models’ architectures. By leveraging these complementary approaches, the aim is to create GPAI models that exhibit enhanced capabilities, overcome existing limitations, and pave the way for a new generation of intelligent systems capable of tackling complex, real-world challenges.</p><p>This topic prioritizes proposals that explore innovative approaches to developing GPAI models, focusing on at least one of the following key research areas:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Hybrid Learning Architectures for Advanced Reasoning: Development of architectures integrating self-supervised learning with symbolic reasoning, knowledge representation, and neuro-symbolic methods to foster robust reasoning, complex planning, and problem-solving abilities within GPAI.</li><li>Continual and Evolutionary Learning for Dynamic Environments: Research on paradigms enabling GPAI models to seamlessly adapt, learn from changing conditions, and retain knowledge essential for operation in dynamic, real-world environments.</li><li>Reinforcement Learning Integration: Research on the fusion of self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning to overcome challenges like non-stationary data, algorithm sensitivity, and computational cost.</li><li>Explainable AI and Trustworthy Decision-Making: Integration of robust XAI methodologies, exploring causal inference and counterfactual reasoning techniques to enhance transparency, accountability, and responsible use of GPAI models in alignment with European values and principles.</li><li>Other Novel Paradigms: Research on the combination of self-supervised learning with other learning paradigms, such as active learning, relational learning, and embodied learning, to equip GPAI models with new advanced capabilities.</li> </ul><p>Proposed projects should aim for a balanced approach between theoretical advancements and practical applications, with a strong emphasis on the development of GPAI models that align with European values and principles, including the AI Act.</p><p>The potential impact of this research extends beyond scientific advancements, as it has the potential to transform key European industries and sectors, including advanced robotics, personalized healthcare, mobility, manufacturing, sustainable energy solutions, and the scientific sector, and to contribute to the EU climate neutrality objective through energy efficiency. Successful projects will contribute to the development of GPAI models that enhance productivity, improve decision-making, and foster innovation across a wide range of domains.</p><p>This topic strongly encourages the formation of interdisciplinary teams combining the necessary technical expertise. Such a collaborative approach will ensure that assessments accurately capture real-world capabilities and risks, and that the developed tools are responsive to the concerns of all relevant stakeholders.</p><p>Proposals must adhere to Horizon Europe's requirements regarding Open Science. Open access to research outputs should be provided unless there is a legitimate reason or constraint.</p><p>All proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. This should include participation in international evaluation contests and the presentation of illustrative application use-cases that demonstrate concrete potential added value. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&amp;D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.</p><p>Proposals should also build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms. Regarding European programmes, proposals are expected to develop synergies and complementarities with relevant projects funded under Horizon Europe but also under the Digital Europe Programme (DEP).</p>"

Special attention will have to be given to security, scalability, and accessibility issues.</li><li>New business opportunities and the emergence of new business and sustainability models based on Open Source.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The aim of this topic is to advance the evolution of the internet towards open and interoperable Web 4.0 enabling Virtual Worlds, ensuring seamless user experience navigating across platforms by increasing the take up of digital commons technologies and other Open Source solutions in Europe. The action will thus leverage the strong and active community of European Open Source innovators that can contribute to relevant digital commons to deliver on key features of virtual worlds.</p><p>This topic will support early demonstrations for Web 4.0 and its architectural framework, through the use of key building blocks where there is sufficient level of maturity and critical mass of commons contributors (such as in the context of the Next Generation Internet initiative).</p><p>The envisaged Web 4.0 shall be powered by open and decentralised technologies enabling interoperability between platforms and networks and freedom of choice for the users. It should be developed through Open Source / digital commons and tackle security, scalability and sustainability at the core of the technological developments.</p><p>Applicants should define the mechanisms for contributing to and aligning with the strategic roadmap for research and innovation and the architectural Framework as it becomes available from the specific separate support action HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-17: Specific support for the Virtual Worlds Partnership and the Web 4.0 initiative (CSA).</p><p>Applicants should devise appropriate mechanisms for cooperating with the other projects under this action to ensure that they work in a coherent way towards the vision of an open, interoperable Web 4.0</p><p>At least one proposal in each of the area defined below will be selected. Proposals should clearly identify the area they are addressing.</p><p><strong>Area 1: Identity management </strong></p><p>Proposals will support and facilitate the deployment and adoption of the EU Digital Identity Wallet with the testing, community development and packaging of Open Source solutions for the issuance and verification of electronic attestations and the provision of eIDAS trust services. The aim is to deliver a diversity of Open Source digital solutions and services in accordance with the European digital rights and principles, empowering citizens with the freedom of choice from many secure digital identity solutions that are aligned with the EU regulations. Additionally, to foster and support enterprises to harness the benefits of the EUDI wallet and the eIDAS trust services. Examples may include the implementation of EUDI wallets for Open Source operating systems, like Linux (for enterprise servers), cloud-based wallets, laptop-based wallets, Open Source Operating System for mobile devices. Furthermore, technical solutions and services for secure and anonymous digital payments and money transfers between people, solutions for the implementation for attestation issuers and verifiers and the eIDAS trust services with a focus on the development of Open Source stacks for issuers and relying parties (for issuing and verifying electronic attestations), especially as/for cloud services. When relevant, proposals may address the validation of physical documents, either IDs or other types of identity-related documents, such as breeder documents.</p><p><strong>Area 2: Software Supply Chain security </strong></p><p>Trusted frameworks are essential to keep the software supply chain secure, as demonstrated by the recent attack on XZ Utils. The aim is to strengthen the security of the software supply chain by leveraging related NGI building blocks and package solutions for example for traceability of code, collaborative trust models among contributors and users, detection of anomalous behaviour, construction of software bill of material. Use cases include developers and users of codes, DevSecOps team, corporate IT, Open Source projects, industry and/or parties that need to be compliant with the Cyber Resilience Act.</p><p><strong>Area 3: Open Hardware </strong></p><p>Open Hardware is key for supporting trust and sovereignty as it allows users to inspect, modify, and implement freely the designs. The aim is to support the uptake of Open Hardware chips and tools through prototyping, productization and integration in real life cases. Proposals can address several re-usable tools and components such as controllers, processors, or network chips. Use cases include consumer devices for immersive virtual worlds, industry applications, consumer devices, smart cities.</p><p><strong>Area 4: Alternative solutions to centralised platforms </strong></p><p>As EU legislation places obligations on platforms, particularly focusing on gatekeepers, it is important to prioritize nurturing and enriching credible alternatives. Proposals in this area could cover integrating, testing and operation of Open Source decentralised solutions offering credible alternatives to users supporting the emergence of Web 4.0 and Virtual Worlds experience. Examples include instant messaging, application stores, or productivity groupware that should showcase virtual worlds interoperability, trust, resilience, and scalability. The focus should be made on decentralised and federated solutions based on interoperability requirements and on open standards to ensure to not only meet regulatory demands but also foster a more open, diverse, resilient, and competitive digital ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Area 5: Web 4.0 demonstration for Virtual Worlds</strong></p><p>Web 4.0 technologies enabling interoperability and transferability across platforms are crucial to ensure various players to contribute to virtual worlds as opposed to a mono-provider environment. This area will make use of existing Open Source building blocks for ensuring trust, interoperation, interconnection, transaction (including tokens), and resource access in Virtual Worlds applications and services. Proposals will aim at integrating the various building blocks, with a special focus on interoperability and will demonstrate seamless interactions (for example when browsing and searching across multiple providers) in one or two selected scenarios.</p><p>For all areas, proposals should innovate beyond the state-of-the-art and could include development, integration, testing, deployment, uptake, and operations activities.</p><p>Proposals should encourage, when relevant, open access to data, standardisation activities, as well as an IPR regime and sustainability model ensuring lasting impact and reusability of results.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals with an overall duration of typically 24 to 36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on Virtual Worlds.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Proposals are expected to address one area of the expected outcomes, either Type A or Type B. The type should be clearly identified within the proposal.</p><p>Type A GenAI4EU<sup>[1]</sup>: Generative AI for Robotics for industrial automation. Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development of advanced foundation models for robotics, fostering increased autonomy and generalization capabilities, thus enabling robots to dynamically learn and comprehend their physical surroundings in real-time, ensuring adaptability and reliability across diverse and complex scenarios.</li><li>Validation of the model through fine-tuning and downstream application to address industrial automation use-cases</li> </ul><p>Type B Trustworthy and robust generative AI for improved manufacturing. Project results are expected to further advance foundation models and reliable industrial solutions and to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes, depending on the use-cases addressed in the proposals:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased productivity by high quality, flexible and resource-efficient industrial automation, both on the shop floor and in engineering/business processes;</li><li>Significantly improved facilitation of product and process certification and compliance assessment, as well as reliability, efficiency and sustainability of manufacturing processes, supporting easier high-mix production and manufacturing of products based on sustainable and advanced technologies; and</li><li>Significantly facilitated installation, commissioning and decommissioning of production facilities, through tools that enable faster industrialisation of factory automation well beyond the pilot phase, while reducing the need for manual on-site interventions.</li><li>Applicants will justify their selection by the expected business dimension of their use cases, while ensuring a critical mass of resources in the project to ensure significant outcomes in these.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals integrating Generative AI in robotics and industrial automation are expected to substantially contribute to productivity gains, including for instance in engineering industries, the automotive sector, food production or other sectors related to manufacturing industries. All proposals will have to demonstrate their expected impact on the competitiveness of the selected application sector.</p><p>The budget will be split in a balanced way between area Type A and Type B defined below. Proposals should clearly identify the area they are addressing.</p><p>Proposals aiming for Type A outcomes should adhere to the Type A scope, while proposals aiming for Type B outcomes should follow the Type B scope.</p><p>Type A Scope: While it is widely acknowledged that current use of generative AI has the potential to impact certain tasks in robotics such as improving user interaction or providing explanations about why a robot system made a particular decision, these are, in general, not within the critical operating flow of a robot. To reach next level of autonomy, generative AI must also enable robots to learn from their experiences, simulate realistic environments for training in challenging conditions, and enhance planning, decision making and control while considering the physical constraints imposed both by the environment and by the physical construction of the robot. This includes integrating 'Human-in-the-loop' mechanisms, where AI systems collaborate with human operators to enhance decision-making processes and adaptability, particularly in dynamic environments.</p><p>This represents a significant advancement in robotics, requiring the development of AI models that can effectively navigate the complexities of the physical world while ensuring safety. Generative AI is expecting to bring such a step-change in robots precision, adaptability, versatility and robustness, enabling them to efficiently achieve real world tasks such as complex moves (navigation, manipulations, etc.) with higher level of autonomy and precision.</p><p>In the context of advancing robotics capabilities, the use of generative AI stands as a transformative force, amplifying robots’ learning, interaction, and operational abilities. By enabling robots to learn from experiences, simulate diverse environments for training, and enhance human-robot interaction, it drives adaptability and efficiency. Additionally, generative AI facilitates the augmentation of robot situational awareness and planning capabilities, empowering them to predict outcomes of various actions, thereby elevating their autonomy and decision-making prowess.</p><p>Training current generative AI models, in particular Large AI models, requires high volumes of data to achieve effective levels of performance. The vast amount of data required present a significant challenge when it comes to robotics. Further research is necessary to find the appropriate balance between the quality, adequacy, and volume of data with regards to the performance of the AI model. Moreover, model distillation techniques may play a key role for the portability of the generative AI solution at the edge, in power-limited devices. The training data should come from the real world or from physical aware simulations of the real world. Where relevant, in particular in the context of human interaction, training data should encompass diverse individual characteristics, such as gender, age, racial and ethnical background, to mitigate potential bias and discriminations.</p><p>Proposals should detail strategies to leverage cutting-edge generative AI techniques to enhance the adaptability and reliability of these models across complex and dynamic scenarios, as well as how to ensure human-centricity and environmental considerations. The goal is to train and fine-tune generative AI models that meet the necessary standards for ensuring the safe operation of robotics hardware. These models should empower robots to autonomously plan and execute actions while maintaining high levels of performance and generalization capabilities.</p><p>Research activities should explore the training methodologies for these foundation models, emphasizing their ability to process multimodal data and derive actionable insights to inform robotic decision-making processes.</p><p>The proposals are also expected to include the validation of the trained models through applications. Proposals should detail methodologies for conducting rigorous testing procedures, incorporating both simulation-based evaluations and physical experiments. These tests aim to evaluate the performance and scalability of developed foundation models.</p><p>The research will be driven by impactful scenarios defined by major manufacturing industry players who should be well integrated in the consortium. They should be deeply involved in the proposed work in order to provide the use-case, the corresponding data and they will play an important role to accompany the validation process. They will define a number of representative real-world use-cases with gradually increased level of complexity to drive the technology development. They will provide existing relevant data and collect further data necessary to train and fine-tune the models, but also to validate the solutions. Given the sensitivity of sharing industrial data, manufacturers present in the consortium have to define upfront mechanisms to collectively provide and pool a sufficiently large dataset for training the models (this might involve a trusted third party as intermediary), ensuring sufficient quality and quantity of data needed to train the models. If necessary, they will have to put in place mechanisms to acquire data from sources outside the consortium.</p><p>Proposals are expected to enhance the accuracy and robustness of generative AI systems in robotics, ensuring that the solutions developed are trustworthy and reliable in their applications, hence in line with the AI Act requirements.</p><p>Proposals should address both the safety of robotic operations, ensuring protection against physical risks, and cybersecurity measures to safeguard against digital threats and ensure system integrity.</p><p>The emphasis lies in creating and disseminating general-purpose models and tools rather than being limited to narrowly focused solutions. Projects should also build on or seek collaboration with existing and upcoming projects and develop synergies and ensure complementarities with other relevant European (e.g. projects funded under HORIZON-CL4-2024-HUMAN-03-01: Advancing Large AI Models: Integration of New Data Modalities and Expansion of Capabilities), national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms.</p><p>Type B Scope:</p><p>The objective is to enhance productivity and provide a competitive advantage to EU industry in the transition towards more sustainable, zero-carbon production, addressing the uncertainties and tensions on supply chains and the lack of highly-skilled workers. A new generation of digital technologies will integrate generative Artificial Intelligence, robotics, and advanced human interfaces in industry-grade applications with a high degree of autonomy. This will enable the development, production, and operation of complex and advanced high-tech products at lower cost while improving sustainability and flexibility, ultimately becoming a powerful tool for accelerating innovation in both processes and products.</p><p>The manufacturing sector should strongly benefit from increased levels of automation made possible by breakthroughs provided by AI, in particular by the family of technologies know as generative AI, including (e.g.) AI foundation models, large language models, transformers, multimodal generative AI. The main objective of this Type B is the development of Generative AI solutions dedicated to the manufacturing sector and making use of manufacturing data available in production lines.</p><p>Proposals should address at least one of the following use-cases:</p><p>1) Robustness and trustworthiness of digital technologies and data management at industry-grade quality, to raise the automation levels on production sites and across industry and supply chains;</p><p>2) Enhanced product and process qualification/certification and compliance assessment through higher levels of automation, digitalisation and data management, taking into account related requirements;</p><p>3) Automation of manufacturing processes to achieve higher reliability, efficiency and sustainability;</p><p>4) Automated tools for fast and large-scale deployment and reconfiguration of production assets and for rapid innovation cycles.</p><p>Proposals should accomplish these objectives exploiting the most suitable approach(es) among the ones described below:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The integration of applications exhibiting advanced developments of generative AI model(s) specifically designed for manufacturing, providing measurable advantages in one of more of these key areas: manufacturing cost, increased productivity, quality, flexibility, resilience, sustainability, circularity, time to market and usability. Applications can target factory-floor operations and/or management of data, knowledge and documentation associated to products and production (for use-case 1 or 2);</li><li>Development and integration of digital production systems capable of significantly increasing productivity and managing high-mix production with close to zero time needed for re-purposing and capability to manage different mixes of materials and components (for use-case 3);</li><li>Development of deployment tools to automate the management of production lines, namely through automatic configuration, integration with legacy systems, placement of data translators and connectors, and deployment of machines and sensors on the shop floor (for use-case 4).</li> </ul><p>Proposals should indicate which approach they are targeting. Proposals may combine several approaches above, indicating which is the main approach, provided there is added value in such a combined approach; arbitrary combinations without integration are excluded.</p><p>The use of generative AI techniques is encouraged for all the approaches. The applicants will specifically describe how they will secure the acquisition of quality manufacturing data from real-world industrial use cases of industry partners or companies outside the consortium in the context of the data volume necessary to train and finetune the models used in the proposal.</p><p>Type A and Type B</p><p>For both Type A and Type B projects, proposal should allocate up to EUR 30 million towards the development of the foundation model. Each project is anticipated to focus on up to six use cases.</p><p>A minimum of EUR 10 million of the proposal budget must be allocated via FSTP for the fine-tuning phase. This phase aims to create Generative AI applications tailored to impactful industry-driven use cases.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>FSTP may be foreseen for up to EUR 2 million per use case, either for a single company (including SME/Start-up), user industry providing their data and use-case, or to a small consortium complementing such user industry company with one or two additional partners, such as AI developer/integrator. Such FSTP initiatives will develop mini-projects, working in close collaboration with the consortium partners, that will dedicate sufficient resources to support such FSTP projects, in order to develop advanced applications and demonstrate with quantitative KPIs the power of Generative AI solutions. These mini-projects will include data preparation, fine-tuning, validation of the Generative AI solution in the selected impactful use-cases.</li> </ul><p>Proposed projects should aim to develop models that align with European values and principles and regulation, including the AI Act. Research should build on existing standards or contribute to standardisation, particularly addressing the needs and requirements of the industry.</p><p>Where relevant, interoperability for data sharing should be addressed, focusing on open specifications and standards, enabling effective cross-domain data communities, and new data-driven markets.</p><p>If high computing resources are necessary, for both Type A and Type B proposals the primary source of computing resources for pretraining should be sought from external high-performance computing facilities such as EuroHPC or National centres. The proposal should describe convincingly the strategy to access these computing resources.</p><p>When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Additionally, proposals should leverage the tools available for the AI and robotics community on the AI on demand platform. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&amp;D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnerships on AI, Data, and Robotic (ADRA) and Made in Europe and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.</p><p>Proposals should also build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national or regional initiatives.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] GenAI4EU is an initiative launched in the context of the AI innovation package, fostering the development of innovative Generative AI solutions to support the competitiveness of Europe’s strategic sectors and industries: <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-launches-ai-innovation-package-support-artificial-intelligence-startups-and-smes\">https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-launches-ai-innovation-package-support-artificial-intelligence-startups-and-smes</a></p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Strengthen European industrial ecosystems for the 3C Network, while enabling the path towards sustainability and competitiveness of key vertical sectors in the EU, to be supported in the work programme 2026-2027 of Horizon Europe by future large-scale pilot focusing on 3Cs demand in vertical industrial sectors such as “industrial virtual worlds” (automotive, aerospace, processing, manufacturing, agriculture, electronics), services (mobility, energy, smart communities, health) or others.</li><li>Strategic industrial cooperation among network and data processing stakeholders which enable new revenue streams in support of viable communication infrastructures by building open platforms, underpinning an emerging industrial open telco edge cloud ecosystem to be established in Europe.</li><li>The pilot should devise appropriate cooperation mechanisms with the Open Internet Stack actions, to help defining the requirements for the development of the building blocks and ensure their integration in the pilot, including envisaging mechanisms for testing and integration of the solutions developed by the Open Internet Stack.</li><li>A European vision of advanced digital infrastructures through the convergence of connectivity with interoperable edge and cloud computing services. Moreover, the large-scale pilot should seek and include sufficient evidence of a clear commitment from the major European telecom, cloud and edge providers to industrialise further the results of the pilot among the major stakeholders, in particular by considering the necessary business adaptations and future perspectives, etc. In this context, an advisory group of end users should be set up to discuss and advise about user requirements to be considered in relation to the pilots. This group will collect requirements from a large range of users and test them through small demonstrations.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The recent Commission White Paper “How to master Europe’s digital infrastructure needs?” highlights the convergence of electronic communications networks and cloud services, and call for the strengthening of the EU “Telco Edge Cloud” infrastructure, by creating the 3C Network (Connected Collaborative Computing).</p><p>The convergence of connectivity, including mobile networks (5G and 5G advanced), combined with computing environments at the edge and cloud is a unique opportunity for the European telecom industry to drive a European vision of next generation digital infrastructures and meet future processing demands of IoT and AI. Investing into future computing and connectivity paradigms will strengthen the industrial European supply side and deliver an enablement for the path towards sustainability of key sectors in the demand side.</p><p>Increased density of edge and cloud facilities is needed to sustain adoption of innovative and sovereign telco edge cloud technologies across Europe. Backed by ubiquitous connectivity to deliver the right performance in terms of bandwidth and latency, Europe’s infrastructure will require advanced network management and orchestration technology as well as neutral interconnection services to guarantee efficient infrastructure utilisation and enable innovative use cases at scale.</p><p>The 3C Network large-scale pilot (focusing on the supply side) aims at setting up end-to-end integrated infrastructures and platforms, bringing together players from different segments of the connectivity and compute value chain and beyond. The main target is to research and validate the integration of device, network, cloud and edge computing, and communication capabilities for telco edge cloud deployments to realize a ubiquitous mesh of computing and communication resources. This will complement the Telco Edge Cloud reference deployments of Digital Europe and IPCEI-CIS and will feed into future deployment initiatives.</p><p>Therefore, the scope for the action would be the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Researching and prototyping at scale end-to-end telco edge cloud integrated infrastructures and platforms, bringing together players from different segments of the connectivity value chain and beyond, such as operators, system integrators, network/cloud/edge suppliers, experts on AI and (wireless) communication, experts on testing and validation of network technologies and services, IoT platform providers et al.</li><li>Developing open orchestration platforms across the telco edge cloud continuum, to support unlocking the transformative value of AI for European businesses and driving business growth in multiple industries strategic for Europe and associated countries.</li><li>Integrating AI solutions for optimising the orchestration of the different resources to be managed by the pilot actions, such as bandwidth, spectrum, computing, hardware, other user requirements.</li><li>Investigation, testing, validation and demonstration of solutions and prototypes of the simultaneous use of integrated devices, edge and cloud computing and communication resources in operational environments (including both public networks and large private networks), ensuring high level of security and privacy, energy efficiency, transparency and control of the ecological footprint.</li><li>Investigation, testing, validation and demonstration of integration of available infrastructures as cloud-edge continuum with distributed systems such as blockchain infrastructure and services, data spaces and seamless and comprehensive AI systems in the process of creation of decentralised digital infrastructure network, including the compliance with applicable EU regulations.</li><li>Exploration of novel approaches for cybersecurity by design and sustainability in advanced communication infrastructure.</li> </ul><p>With radical changes triggered by GenAI, as well as AI applications penetrating more and more industrial domains, demands for low latency are looming. The pilot should have to tackle the network evolution complementing the cloud with progress towards the edge, as well as needing reliability from the mobile networks.</p><p>Key aspects to be researched, validated and demonstrated by the 3C Network end-to-end infrastructures include:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>AI-enabled orchestration and quality assurance tools, algorithms and techniques which cater for hybrid multi-cloud technologies.</li><li>Enablers for multi-level (networks, edge, cloud, and services) federation management and interoperability.</li><li>Tools and mechanisms that facilitate the standardised exposure of network functions.</li><li>Enablement of Edge-as-a-Service approaches that effectively integrate cloud computing's multi-tenancy and resource sharing concepts into access networks.</li><li>Security and Compliance mechanisms targeted for telco edge cloud.</li><li>Tools for guaranteed end-to-end QoS and QoE across heterogeneous network, cloud and edge infrastructures.</li><li>Mechanisms to exploit specialised hardware and accelerators to address the strict the requirements (e.g. latency, energy efficiency) of virtualised network functions.</li><li>Investigation on the trade-offs associated to Edge nodes density and placement required in telco edge cloud deployments to achieve the target latency rates.</li><li>Lightweight virtualisation and cloud-native approaches for virtualised network functions.</li><li>Novel approaches to handle user mobility to ensure edge service continuity and quality of service.</li><li>Privacy preserving record linkage on individual citizen level and device-related level to foster meaningful linkage of data for secondary usage.</li> </ul><p>Thanks to these, the pilot and its associated research should support the emergence of telco edge cloud as-a-service approaches that successfully implement multi-tenancy and resource sharing notions from cloud computing into network infrastructure and resources. In addition, the project infrastructures should cater for the pragmatic complexities associated with the physical placement of the various types of telco edge cloud platforms (near, far, regional,) across the territory considering the necessary trade-offs between performance, capacity, and costs.</p><p>Furthermore, the pilot should tackle the need for multi-cloud and edge service orchestration at scale, which enables workload portability across providers and technologies as well as effective service placement and lightweight and cloud-native forms for NFV and optimisation by means of acceleration, multi-cloud orchestration, multi-level federation and mobility management.</p><p>Moreover, the technical solutions in the pilot should investigate the use of AI to handle the optimal allocation and optimisation of the operation of the digital infrastructures resultant of the combination of distributed compute and network resources of the edge cloud compute continuum in a predictive and efficient manner and at scale. These should take into consideration the appropriate QoS trade-offs in relation to bandwidth, spectrum, computing, hardware and other functional and non-functional requirements, cater for the need for AI/ML to improve optimisation of assets and process and closed-loop automation, and target development and life-cycle management of AI models and resource management tools for the optimal management of combined and converged network, cloud and edge infrastructures. It will integrate security and privacy by design into account and seek to incorporate mechanisms such as edge discovery and deployment as-a-service delivery, end-to-end network and compute performance, energy efficiency and mobility management, including the Non-Terrestrial Network component for ubiquity.</p><p>The pilot should provide an <strong><em>open, multi-supplier, multi-vendor, and interoperable Telco Edge Cloud reference architecture and ecosystem</em></strong> that encourages cooperation and cooperative development among all key stakeholders, with broad representation of MS/AC, owing to the joint research to be implemented. Furthermore, the pilot should define open access policies and mechanisms that aim to maximise the impact of the provided infrastructure which take into consideration the long-term sustainability and addressing different uses by industrial and research communities. When necessary, these should explore collaboration with complementary actions addressing the demand side.</p><p>Project participants should analyse the existing standards landscape as a key state-of-the-art input when planning their project activities, and relevant open-source projects (e.g., Sylva, ANUJET, Nephio, CAMARA). The development paths of the critical technologies are expected to be merged and aligned to support the standardisation and uptake of 6G and Web 4.0.</p><p>The pilot should help maturing the technologies resulting from medium TRLs projects, while performing its own research towards enabling and prototyping of converged telco cloud edge platforms in operational and multi-suppliers, multi-domain and multi-tenant environments.</p><p>The pilot should cover research on infrastructure and platforms mid-TRLs telco edge cloud technologies, including development of telco-cloud network resources orchestration, demos, proof of concepts and early deployment of technologies.</p><p>The main achievements of the pilot should be showcased by means of small-scale demonstrations, that could be scaled up in future work programmes, for instance demonstrators on virtual worlds for industrial settings.</p><p>The pilot should ensure a high degree of participation of stakeholders from the relevant technological sectors, including SMEs, scaleups and start-ups, as well as properly consider the demand side from vertical sectors and broad representation of MS/AC, also in view of the planned demand-side large-scale pilots. In this regard, proposals should clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the participating stakeholders in developing, testing, validating, updating, maintaining and/ or using the technologies and services of the 3Cs network. The pilot’s Consortium should also define a policy on the ownership and access of 3Cs network resources and facilities, during the Horizon Europe project and beyond.</p><p>Proposals are expected to build synergies and ensure complementarities with relevant topics under SNS JU Work Programme 2022-2024, Digital Europe Programme WP2023-2024, IPCEI-CIS, Connecting Europe Facility.</p><p>The large-scale pilot would ideally reuse and extend relevant open-source frameworks and capitalise on existing testing and trial platforms from European or national initiatives <sup>[1]</sup> among which the IPCEI-CIS, SNS Stream C (dedicated to the development of EU-wide experimentation platforms incorporating promising 6G enablers), SNS Stream D projects (which focuses on implementing large-scale trials and targets specific verticals of high economic and societal importance), and other SNS projects, results from Open Internet Stack action, the Cloud-Edge-IoT HE projects, and the Digital Europe Programme’s Reference edge-cloud deployments, the “Empowering AI across the continuum” and the “Software engineering for AI” R&amp;I areas, as well as research results on infrastructure and platforms. It should also establish strong relationship and collaboration with complementary EU-funded research activities, and also ensure close interaction with the relevant constituencies driving that research, including the Open Internet Stack constituencies. Relevant research from both the supply and the demand side of 3C networks should be considered in this regard, thus ensuring participation of research organisations from all across the value chain.</p><p>Finally, digital autonomy in edge and cloud implies that computation infrastructure should be able to be sourced from European technology, including non-terrestrial network infrastructure. The subsequent step following the EU investments in processors for HPC (under the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking) is to extend its success to the rest of the computing continuum. Therefore, the project will also seek to coordinate with other EU (HE) research activities with a view to integrating new processor architectures into cloud edge infrastructures as they become available.</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] Such as UNICO 6G in Spain, CAMPUS-OS in Germany, 6G Flagship in Finland, etc.</p>"

Small and frugal AI models would enable faster inference contributing to lower latency while improving security and privacy by processing data closer to the user, preserving EU Values. Smart digital assistants will accompany users throughout their journey within Virtual Worlds, bringing new innovative communication modalities, advancing collaborative intelligence and decision-making AI capabilities.</p><p>Innovation actions proposals are expected to address:</p><p><strong>Generative AI – Realistic and innovative Virtual Worlds for a better immersion</strong>:</p><p>Proposals should use Generative AI to build on the users’ expectations to create either safe and inclusive virtual spaces, realistic environments, or creative and beyond reality ones. They should develop dynamic Storytelling and scenarios to enable creative content that is personalised leading to unique experiences for the users or shared with other users. They should also use AI to enable generation of personalised avatars aiming to provide seamless and more realistic immersive interaction.</p><p><strong>Generative AI – Smart digital assistance for a safe and inclusive navigation in Virtual Worlds</strong>:</p><p>Proposals should develop smart people-centered and accessible digital assistants and 3D chatbots (AI-enhanced communicating 3D avatars), to for example, enhance training and education, remove language barriers or language disorders through instant translation, including sign languages, remove barriers to persons with disabilities, offer sentiment analysis and behavioural decision support systems, enable users to adapt to various interlocutors from various cultures, languages and backgrounds, contributing to navigate in inclusive and safe Virtual Worlds, while offering users new adapted learning modalities. When relevant, proposals can capitalise on latest developments in generative AI, to bring step change in explainable collaborative intelligence and decision-making capabilities by dedicated specific research.</p><p>We consider that proposals with an overall duration of typically 36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations.</p><p>Proposals should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines and SSH experts, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>This topic is implemented as a joint effort between the co-programmed European Partnership for Virtual Worlds and the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with both partnerships, including the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-17: Specific support for the Virtual Worlds Partnership and the Web 4.0 initiative and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.</p><p>When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&amp;D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.</p><p>Proposals should also build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies and complementarities with other relevant International, European, national or regional initiatives.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Significant technology progress and innovation through challenge-driven approach in the fields of aerospace, pharma/drug development or telecommunication networks.</li><li>Increased competitivity and visibility of the Generative AI community in Europe, in demonstrating their capability to achieve challenging tasks within the aerospace, pharma/drug development or telecommunication sectors.</li><li>Increased adoption of Generative AI in aerospace, pharma/drug development or telecommunication networks through tangible progress and achievement demonstrated via the challenge-driven process. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Generative AI (GenAI) promises to transform most industry sectors. This challenge-driven initiative aims to boost both Europe’s developer community and the adoption of powerful trustworthy generative AI solutions in the strategic sectors of aerospace, pharma/drugs and telecommunication networks, key for their competitiveness. In pharmaceuticals, it can, for instance, accelerates drug design by rapidly creating target-specific molecules, reducing development time from years to seconds, and potentially preventing prolonged health crises like COVID-19. In aerospace, generative AI can for instance optimize aircraft design, streamline manufacturing processes, predict maintenance needs through sensor data analysis, route optimisation, and enhance pilot training with diverse, realistic simulations. By embracing generative AI, telecom companies can position themselves at the forefront of a new era of intelligent and automated telecommunications. Specific use-cases include for instance network management, network optimization, network slicing, network healing, predictive maintenance, network mapping and optimization.</p><p>Each proposal should focus exclusively on one of the three key sectors mentioned above: aerospace, pharma/drug development, or telecommunications and clearly specify which sector it addresses. Each proposal is expected to focus primarily on the definition, the organization of a multi-stage competition in the chosen sector, as well as the accompanying support to the companies/teams taking part in the challenges, and related activities to maximise the impact of the action.</p><p>User industry companies from the strategic sector targeted by the proposal should be core partners in the consortium. They should demonstrate a genuine interest in the projects results and therefore support the challenge participants - in order to reach the most powerful and exploitable results benefitting their industry. The expected results are pre-competitive but the proposal must include a draft exploitation plan outlining commitments on future exploitation. The consortium is responsible for the various stages of the challenges and should provide the necessary support resources during each stage of the competition, including technical assistance and business support to develop an exploitation strategy, but most importantly, provide the data necessary to fine-tune models and build powerful solutions meeting industry needs.</p><p>Proposals should be driven by impactful use-cases where generative AI can make the difference: a number of industries from the targeted sector are expected to join forces to define challenging problems to solve with GenAI solutions, which then drive the rest of the project. Based on such challenges, the consortium organises a multi-staged competition with an increasing level of complexity. In the first two stages, third parties, either single companies (typically start-ups or SMEs) or small team of organisations built around such start-ups/SMEs, compete to address the challenges with GenAI solutions. After these stages, the solutions retained for the last stage will be invited to join the consortium, as full beneficiaries.</p><p>For each proposal:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Stage 1: a challenge, open to all, will allow to select for stage 2 the 20 highest ranked solutions, according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria. Each solution competing for the challenge can be submitted either by a single start-up/SME, developer of GenAI solutions, or a small team of organisations built around such start-up/SME</li><li>Stage 2: the 20 solutions selected from stage 1 receive EUR 250 000 FSTP funding, in form of a grant, in order to address the challenge set for this stage by the consortium. At the end of stage 2, the 4 highest ranked competing solutions will be selected for the next stage according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria.</li><li>Stage 3: after the end of stage 2 and the corresponding FSTP scheme, the 4 selected solutions will be invited to join the consortium and receive EUR 2 millions grants each (as part of the eligible costs of the grant agreement) to prepare for the grand finale. The consortium should define measures to maximise the impact for the team winning the grand finale at the end of the third stage, and maximise the uptake of their solutions (for instance, the best performing team could be offered the opportunity to conclude partnerships or contracts with the user industries leading the consortium. Measures to support the broad uptake of their solutions in the whole sector should also be considered). </li> </ul><p>Such multi-staged scheme is expected to be implemented in parallel by the successful proposals, each addressing a different sector.</p><p>Each proposal, involving several major industry players, should define a clear methodology to implement the various steps of the approach, define the specifications of the stages of the competitions, timelines, targets, KPIs, a solid evaluation methodology including evaluation criteria. The main information should be in the proposal, even if refinements could be further developed during the project. The proposers will also be in charge of implementing the evaluation methodology, and providing the necessary infrastructure/technical support for the participants to the challenges. The consortium members are also responsible for ensuring high visibility of the competitions, including possible sponsorships.</p><p>The actions selected from this call, each addressing one of the three targeted sectors, are expected to collaborate among themselves, in order to make economies of scale in sharing best practices, defining processes for organising the challenges, ensuring efficient monitoring, organising dissemination and communication activities, etc. Such collaboration among the linked actions is expected to be formalised by a collaboration agreement, after the Grant Agreement signature.</p><p>For each proposal, an amount of EUR 5 millions is foreseen to be distributed among the winners of stage 1, in form of FSTP grants, in order to prepare for stage 2. In addition, a budget of EUR 8 millions is reserved in the initial grant, to carry out the stage 3 of the challenge. The proposal is expected to make the case for such investment in defining the objectives with sufficient level of information, even if the details are to be further elaborated in the course of the project. Such amount will be distributed equally among the 4 winning teams of the stage 2, who will be invited to join the consortium as beneficiaries to develop further the solutions and compete for the stage 3 of the challenge.</p><p>Visibility would be important; therefore dissemination and communication campaigns are key. The proposers are also encouraged to seek sponsorship, which would be key for the visibility and prestige of their challenge, and to attract the best developers from the EU and associated countries to compete, particularly SMEs and startups, alone or within a team competing for the challenges.</p><p>All proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. This should include the methodology to accompany the challenge participants to the various stages during the project, and the assessment methodology during the various selection stages. As part of the KPIs, efficiency gains from Generative AI should be considered, to maximize broader impact.</p><p>When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&amp;D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.</p><p>Proposals should also build on or seek collaboration with relevant projects<sup>[1]</sup> and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national or regional initiatives.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] In particular, proposals in telecommunication should exploit potential synergies with projects funded under HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-DATA-08, HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-DATA-09 and HORIZON-CL4-2025-04-DATA-02; proposals in pharma/drug should exploit potential synergies with relevant projects from Cluster 1 and IHI Innovative Health Initiative; proposals in the aerospace should exploit potential synergies with relevant projects from the clean aviation JU and other similar projects/initiatives.</p>"

This CSA is expected to bring together all those stakeholders. In any case, the CSA action should be prepared, managed and coordinated by key stakeholders in the field, while it would be important that the coordinator adopts a neutral position.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Coordination of the different stakeholder communities in the scope of the supply LSP work (software, hardware, computing, telcos, AI, cloud...), bringing stakeholders together to work on a common plan and technology roadmap on supply and demand of end-to-end infrastructures integrating device, network computing and communication capabilities, monitoring implementation and identifying gaps.</li><li>Enable the supply-side LSP to consider the demand-side perspective, including requirements from the different applications/user communities.</li><li>Help stakeholders build small, and later larger-scale, demos based on the developments of the supply-side LSP, as well as developments from future Horizon research actions as possible and appropriate.</li><li>Assist stakeholders from the different segments of the value chain (telecoms, software providers, middleware stack providers, etc.) to converge towards a shared approach, while modular and flexible, for telco-edge-cloud infrastructure and services</li><li>Put in place mechanisms for exchange, collaboration and shared governance to facilitate smooth cooperation between supply and demand-side activities, including the Open Internet Stack, towards a common platform approach across industrial actors, including a repository with critical mass of largely open-source building blocks, as well as maintenance and support services.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The expected scope of the CSA for this governance mechanism to function would be the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Consolidate priorities and maximise benefits across different demand perspectives and timelines for key infrastructure services to be implemented.</li><li>Ensure alignment of demand and supply side strategies and roadmaps, in line with (and contributing to) the White Paper on communication infrastructures and other relevant EU policy.</li><li>Ensure coordination and integration of the work of the actions on the supply side pilot and the Open Internet Stack.</li><li>Open-source delivery of Telco Edge Cloud building blocks by the supply side pilot, which will be the foreseen backbone to articulate the cooperation among supply- and demand-side LSPs.</li><li>These open-source modules should be aligned with industrial interests and where appropriate with common European building blocks including with the developments at IPCEI-CIS Telco Edge Cloud community initiatives (e.g. Sylva, Anuket, Nephio and CAMARA).<sup>[1]</sup></li><li>The demand-side developments in the relevant verticals will offer a continuous feedback loop to the supply side endeavours, while they will benefit from the progressive developments of the supply LSP.</li><li>Provide a foundation for exploitation of European technology developed under the 3C initiative as an alternative to the platforms led by large multinationals. The project should provide a forum for consultation and input of the demand-side application sectors and verticals into the development of the supply-side architecture and building blocks.</li><li>Identification of paradigms shifts evolving in relevant vertical domains like virtual worlds as a driver for emerging network virtualisation and performance as well as vertical services like mobility, communities or energy.</li><li>Assessment of monetising edge computing, interoperability of middleware and SW framework through trend scouting on markets, value chains and ecosystems in the area of dynamic content delivery, AI adoption for telco operation and edge computing, convergence across the telco-cloud-edge- IoT continuum.</li> </ul><p>Proposals are expected to build synergies with relevant topics under Digital Europe Programme (DEP) and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] Sylva – Linux Foundation Projects Site (sylvaproject.org); Camara Project – Linux Foundation Project.</p>"

Issues like hardware-supported mixed-precision, AI-driven HPC as a service, real-time HPC, next generation AI model training and inference, digital continuum, convergence of HPC/AI/Quantum/Cloud/Edge, should be part of the analysis.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals with an overall duration of typically 24/36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations. Only one proposal will be selected for funding.</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and/or gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement; however, should proposers consider it to be of relevance for their proposal, they are strongly encouraged to integrate it.</p><p>Projects are expected to develop synergies with relevant projects funded under the Digital Europe Programme (DEP).</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Proposals should result in an enhanced and integrated support instrument for fabless startups, SMEs and mid-caps that drives collective growth and innovation. The outcomes should include:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>A sustainable and active organization or network that represents the interests of European fabless SMEs (e.g. the consortium could form an open industry association).</li><li>A comprehensive framework facilitating dialogue between fabless SMEs and European stakeholders, including public authorities and key industrial actors, to address sector-specific needs and challenges.</li><li>A platform providing fabless SMEs with easy access to up-to-date information on relevant calls and funding opportunities, policy and regulatory developments, as well as key technological updates.</li><li>Active representation of fabless SMEs in high-profile forums and events, to strengthen their role and influence within the European semiconductor ecosystem.</li><li>Targeted services to support startup acceleration and scaling, with emphasis on advanced semiconductor technologies, such as chips for AI, low-power computing, autonomous driving, integrated photonics, etc.</li> </ul><p>This CSA invites proposals that can foster a collaborative and inclusive European fabless ecosystem, capable of thriving in a dynamic global market.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Fabless semiconductor start-ups and SMEs play a key role in driving innovation and economic growth within the global technology sector. These companies, which design chips and outsource their manufacturing, are at the forefront of technological advancements, fueling innovative developments in semiconductor technologies related to AI, data processing, communications, automotive, and more. Globally, fabless companies contribute to approximately 50% of chip revenues. However, Europe’s share in this crucial market is less than 1%, highlighting a significant gap that needs to be addressed to strengthen Europe’s strategic autonomy and economic security. European fabless startups and SMEs often face significant challenges in accessing cohesive and timely information, financial resources, and relevant infrastructures and services. Nurturing and supporting the growth of European fabless SMEs is essential for building a competitive ecosystem that fosters rapid innovation, job creation, and sustainable growth. This Coordination and Support Action (CSA) aims to bridge this gap by providing targeted support and advocacy for Europe’s fabless semiconductor start-ups, SMEs and small mid-caps, ensuring their voice is heard and their potential is fully realized.</p><p>The CSA will support European fabless start-ups, SMEs and mid-caps by establishing a coordination and knowledge hub to foster collaboration, improve access to strategic resources, and bridge the gap between them and decision-making entities. The proposed actions will aim to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Establish a sustainable organization or network, potentially through the formation of an open industry association, to represent the interests of European fabless SMEs.</li><li>Promote dialogue and advocacy between fabless SMEs and European stakeholders, including public authorities and policymakers, while representing their interests with key industrial actors (such as foundries, EDA vendors, and design houses) as well as relevant initiatives of the Chips for Europe Initiative, the Chips Joint Undertaking and the IPCEIs on Microelectronics. </li><li>Enhance the visibility and engagement of fabless start-ups and SMEs in EU policy-making to leverage their innovation potential, strengthening Europe’s leadership in critical industry domains and in advanced semiconductors such as for AI, HPC, quantum, communications, advanced sensing, power systems and autonomous driving technologies and applications.</li><li>Align with relevant support actions in key EU programmes, including coordination with the network of the European Semiconductor Competence Centres and the Design Platform under the \"Chips for Europe Initiative\".</li><li>Develop a central platform (a one stop-shop) for semiconductor start-ups and SMEs that aggregates and disseminates all essential information they need (e.g., policy updates, public and private funding opportunities, and technological advancements) and facilitates access to funding and investment opportunities.</li><li>Organize and participate in events, including workshops and conferences, to enhance the profile of fabless startups and SMEs, and strengthen their role in the broader European semiconductor ecosystem.</li><li>Foster partnerships and innovation through networks that connect start-ups and SMEs, promoting cross-sector knowledge-sharing and joint projects to advance technological solutions and business growth.</li> </ul><p>The action should be coordinated and driven by the relevant representative European start-up and SME stakeholders operating in the field.</p><p><em>Links with topics in other WPs</em>: Chips JU WP 2024 and 2025</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The launch of the co-programmed new European Partnership for Virtual Worlds will help develop and promote a thriving industrial and end-user ecosystem in the EU, covering all the aspects of the virtual worlds value chain. It will also actively engage with people and society at large and provide access to a broader range of resources, including funding, expertise and technology.</p><p>This CSA should be prepared, managed and coordinated by the key stakeholders in this field. Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>The delivery of a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) for Virtual Worlds in Europe, for useful, open, interoperable, inclusive, sustainable and trustworthy virtual worlds systems and applications, ensuring Virtual worlds reflect EU values and principles.</li><li>The delivery of a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) for Web 4.0 in Europe leading to an inclusive, trustworthy, interoperable, and human-centric Web 4.0 leveraging open-source commons building blocks enabling new social and sustainability models that respect European values.</li><li>Established and running European Virtual Worlds Partnership supporting the European Virtual Worlds and Web 4.0 community.</li><li>A strong and competitive ecosystem, with European companies playing a leading role in the adoption and acceptance, and in the development and deployment of Virtual Worlds technologies.</li><li>Reinforced links among initiatives in virtual worlds in Horizon Europe, Digital Europe Programme, and other programmes at EU, national and regional levels.</li><li>Widespread awareness and outreach programmes</li><li>Increased adoption of virtual worlds that are open, accessible and inclusive, interdisciplinary, safe and respect ethical values and European legal framework, including regarding privacy, security in all Member States and Associated Countries</li><li>Standardisation methods for virtual worlds technologies and in support of the EU regulatory framework.</li> </ol><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The selected proposal should provide specific support for the coming European Virtual Worlds Partnership.</p><p>The selected proposal should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Support to the Virtual Worlds Partnership to develop a strong and inclusive network by strengthening the links and promoting collaboration among academia, industry, public actors and end-users, including the major industrial European sectors and all relevant stakeholders, to guarantee strong coordinated efforts toward trustworthy and human-centric virtual worlds for the economy and society. The network will also include national representatives, to link to national programmes and to foster synergies and coordination between the various European, national, public and private initiatives. Such coordination of efforts in research, innovation and expertise will be important for Europe’s leadership in virtual worlds. The objective is to support the community in defining and implementing the Virtual Worlds strategy for research, innovation, and deployment, and support the Partnership in its coordination and support of the community in non-R&amp;D tasks as well.</li><li>Support the development and implementation of a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda for Virtual Worlds (SRIA).</li><li>Support the development of a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) for Web 4.0 in Europe and propose an implementation agenda of a European Web 4.0 strategy for research and innovation by defining the trajectories to drive the evolution of the internet towards Web 4.0. This should include the architectural framework (including standards and protocols) and principles, identifying its main building blocks. The implementation strategy should also identify the technology areas where Web 4.0 and Virtual Worlds can benefit from joint developments, reuse of technologies or exchanges.</li><li>Support the emergence of a thriving European ecosystem for Web 4.0 where developers, research teams, industry and startups can boost technological capabilities, accelerate uptake of innovative solutions, and foster a supportive business environment. This community is expected to be involved in the definition of the architectural framework, its main building blocks and the implementation roadmap.</li><li>Support and encourage the adoption of Virtual Worlds in all Member States and Associated Countries, with particular emphasis on geographical aspect and across the value chain.</li><li>Develop and implement outreach programmes aiming at better understanding and awareness of Virtual Worlds including acceptability and trustworthiness, informing about potentialities of Virtual Worlds but also ensuring that public expectations are realistic to avoid backlash in the adoption. Such activities should target in particular the business community, with a particular focus on SMEs, as well as public administrators, citizens and civil society at large.</li><li>Identify ethical, legal, societal and economic aspects of virtual worlds and actions on how to tackle possible issues. Particular attention should be paid to gender, racial, and other biases as well as mitigation measures.</li><li>Support to standardisation in view of boosting virtual worlds industry, creating, and guaranteeing trustworthy and ethical Virtual Worlds, by bringing stakeholders together and, when needed, organise European representation in existing or new standardisation working groups in support of the Commission regulatory framework.</li> </ul><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on Virtual Worlds and the initiative on Web 4.0.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to build on, or seek collaboration with, existing projects and develop synergies and ensure complementarities with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives and funding programmes relevant for Web 4.0 and Virtual Worlds in Horizon Europe, Digital Europe Programme (such as the Common European Data spaces or the Digital Twins) and other programmes (European Innovation Council, Digital Innovation Hubs, European Digital Innovation Hubs, European Digital Infrastructure Consortia, the VR/AR Industrial Coalition, etc). Such synergies and complementarities should be developed through efficient mechanisms (e.g. joint task forces), organisation of joint events gathering projects, etc.</p><p>In particular links are encouraged with:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>HORIZON-CL4-2023-HUMAN-01-21: Next Generation eXtended Reality (RIA)</li><li>HORIZON-CL4-2023-HUMAN-01-22: eXtended Reality for Industry 5.0 (IA)</li><li>HORIZON-CL4-2023-HUMAN-01-23: Supporting the emergence of an open human-centric Metaverse (CSA)” In view of sharing knowledge and developing synergies, proposals are also encouraged to coordinate, establish links and ensure complementarities with relevant initiatives in this Work Programme, especially:</li><li>HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-DATA-11: Open Internet Stack: development of technological commons/open-source 3C building blocks (RIA)</li><li>HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-DATA-08: Large-scale pilots for supply end-to-end infrastructures integrating device, network computing and communication capabilities for Telco Edge Cloud deployments, as a basis for Connected Collaborative Computing Networks (3C networks) (RIA)</li><li>HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-14: Core technologies for virtual worlds (RIA) (Virtual Worlds and Photonics Partnerships)</li><li>HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-15: GenAI4EU: Generative AI for Virtual Worlds: Advanced technologies for better performance and hyper personalised and immersive experience (IA) (AI/Data/Robotics &amp; Virtual Worlds Partnerships)</li><li>HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-16: Drive the evolution of the internet towards open and interoperable Web 4.0 and Virtual Worlds: building blocks in priority areas (RIA) (Virtual Worlds Partnership)</li> </ul><p>Proposals are encouraged also to closely collaborate and build synergies and complementarities with other relevant European Partnerships (such as Data, AI and Robotics; Photonics, the European Blockchain Partnerships); Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, the European Flagships (such as Graphene), the EU supported digital twins initiatives (such as Destination Earth).</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals with an overall duration of typically 36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations.</p><p>Proposals should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines and SSH experts, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>All proposals are expected to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with the Partnership on Virtual Worlds and funded actions related to this partnership.</p>"

Innovative and advanced materials (IAMs) can enable new technologies and the much-needed paradigm of an electronic device that can adapt to any substrate. Despite the progress made in this field, current devices are made up of a limited proportion of flexible, conformable, and stretchable components, mainly sensors, while the rest of the circuit remains rigid, limiting this technology shift.</p><p>The overall objective is to discover Innovative Advanced Materials (IAMs), including 2DMs, with improved properties in terms of flexibility, conformability and stretchability that can enable novel flexible electronic applications, with a focus on environmentally friendly technologies with reduced carbon footprint processing. Proposals should address most of the following challenges:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Discomfort of existing wearables leading to non-adoption</li><li>Environmental impact of current electronics due to the use of hazardous and/or critical raw materials, energy-hungry and resources intensive processes</li><li>Low or limited performance and durability of existing materials for high performance and reliable flexible electronic devices and circuits</li><li>Limited integrability of current electronics: size and/or weight, complex cabling, interface between flexible and rigid components, design limitations (i.e., pattern geometry, thickness, dimensions).</li> </ul><p>Proposals should address reparability and/or recyclability of devices and circuits e.g. reversible adhesives and interconnects, low temperature soldering, bio-based or recycled substrates such as low thermal budget paper and inks, bio-resorbable conductive materials for the next generation of transient implanted medical devices, etc., compatibility with energy and resource efficient manufacturing processes e.g., printing, thermoforming, high pressure forming, lamination, injection moulding, etc.</p><p>Where relevant, proposers are encouraged to take advantage of and connecting to European analytical research infrastructures and services such as the ones in the ARIE network <sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p>Proposals should also consider building their innovations on top of relevant existing standards and consider standardisation as part of innovation and dissemination activities.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership Innovative Advanced Materials for Europe (IAM4EU). Proposals funded under this topic are part of the IAM4EU partnership portfolio and are expected to develop synergies with the related stakeholder community and contribute actively to the objectives of the partnership. Proposals should seek collaboration, with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national, or regional initiatives, funding programmes such as the Graphene Flagship <sup>[2]</sup> for proposals investigating 2D materials. In addition, outreach to relevant national projects in EU Member States and Associated Countries is encouraged. Adequate resources for all these synergies should be foreseen in the proposal.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] https://arie-eu.org/</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] Graphene Flagship: https://graphene-flagship.eu/</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>A publicly available and operational stack of strategic commons focusing on internet technologies for trust, transactions, connectivity, and decentralisation implementing the European vision of next generation digital infrastructures, in particular the 3Cs networks (in close cooperation with the 3Cs large scale pilots), and the wider Web 4.0.</li><li>A library of inclusive, trustworthy, interoperable, and human-centric applications and services leveraging Open-Source commons building blocks which will increase the value of the network in the respect of European values. These Open Source solutions will be integrated and tested / validated in the 3C large scale pilot.</li><li>A flourishing European ecosystem of contributors to digital commons– e.g., individuals, SMEs, academics - stimulated by critical challenges around sovereignty, trust, and user empowerment.</li> </ul><p>Tools, services, and insights supporting compliance with and implementation of EU legal framework e.g., EUDI, CRA, DMA, DSA, GDPR, Data Act, DGA.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This action will foster an Open-Source framework, developed through commons<u>,</u> i.e. Open Source software governed by communities of contributors, that will provide key technology components for the operation of the 3C large scale pilot. They will be addressing relevant areas, structuring them in a stack and supporting the development of 3C building blocks making them available through a library of digital commons supporting applications on top of the European providers ecosystem.</p><p>It will mainly cover three technology areas:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Trust technologies such as privacy enhancing technologies, AI-based agents and trusted technologies for identities allowing exchanges across multiple 3C networks, providing the users with transparent, auditable, secure, and resilient building blocks and tools across the internet stack.</li><li>Network and connectivity technologies according to the identified needs of the 3C large scale pilot.</li><li>Decentralised technologies for an immersive world notably based on open standards ensuring interoperable flow of data and events across the 3C pilot networks and operators.</li> </ul><p>In order to implement the European vision of next generation digital infrastructures (3Cs networks), applicants should devise appropriate mechanisms for cooperation with the 3C pilot:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>To ensure the integration of requirements and specifications stemming from the 3C large scale pilots.</li><li>To ensure the 3C large scale pilot’s swift integration of the building blocks developed by the Open Internet Stack, including envisaging mechanisms for testing and integration of the solutions.</li> </ul><p>Applicants should provide concrete plans on how such work should be organised in close cooperation with the 3C large scale pilot to decide the building blocks that will be prioritised, facilitate their integration in the 3C large scale pilot and avoid any duplication of the work. If applicants opt for financial support to third parties, the solutions selected under the Open Calls should form a coherent portfolio and duplications should be avoided. The 3C CSA will ensure co-ordination and monitoring for duplication risks across the 3C projects’ activities.</p><p>Applicants could also decide to select and fund third party projects, wherever required, through up to 70% of their project’s budget for financial support to third parties.</p><p>If applicants opt for financial support to third parties, they should target calls towards the Open-Source communities actively influencing the course of the Internet. This action is aimed in particular at leveraging the European Open Source community – SMEs, research institutes and individual researchers and developers – with solid experience with development of solutions in line with EU rules and values. The calls should aim at improving trust, transactions, decentralisation implementing optimal balance between distribution, security (including AI for security), AI usage and energy efficiency targeting climate neutrality objectives. Applicants should then also define the mechanisms for maturing third parties’ projects e.g., security and accessibility audits, packaging of the stack for easy deployment, localisation of the software in EU languages, documentation best practices, performance optimisation and advising on licensing.</p><p>Applicants should detail the path to growth for third parties’ projects e.g., by actively animating communities, creating momentum among like-minded efforts, defining how projects will gain critical mass and what services will be provided for reaching such stage. Proposals should also detail the strategy for standardisation.</p><p>In addition to contributing to the 3C large scale pilot, applicants should demonstrate how the software produced will be operationalised as a stack of open libraries accessible through a common European repository and maximising re-use, reproducibility, and resilience for adopters.</p><p>Applicants should actively manage the portfolio of funded projects and provide a coherent overall picture in relation to the 3Cs objectives, describing how mature solutions are and ensuring trusted and easy deployment capabilities for each building block through packaged stack.</p><p>Applicants should strive for identification of common tools and stimulate maximum re-use of components coming from other funded projects e.g., interoperable identity and credential management tools, common packaging solutions, tools for decentralised social media.</p><p>Applicants should seek active collaboration with other initiatives addressing internet commons of relevance to 3Cs at national, European levels and beyond Europe including with European technology industries.</p><p>Applicants should demonstrate their experience and understanding of Open-Source communities and their expertise covering the full Open-Source life cycle through proven track record including years of experience and indication of volume of Open-Source projects supported.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals in this topic with an overall duration of typically 36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations.<strong> </strong></p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.</p><p><strong>Financial support to third parties </strong></p><p>Third parties will be funded through projects typically in the EUR 50 000 to 150 000 range per project, with indicative duration of 9 to 12 months. The consortium should provide the programme logic for the third-party projects, managing the projects lifecycle, and provide the necessary technical and non-technical support: these tasks cannot be implemented using the budget earmarked for the financial support to third parties.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:</p><p>1. Act as a global observatory of quantum technologies, systematically reporting on the latest advancements and breakthroughs occurring worldwide. Provide regular assessments to the European Commission and Member States, specifically to the Quantum Technologies Coordination Group established in line with the Quantum Declaration, offering a detailed analysis of Europe's standing relative to global competitors. This will ensure Europe can strategically respond to emerging trends and innovations.</p><p>2. Capitalize on the accomplishments and infrastructure (e.g. online presence) established by the current CSA to further elevate Europe's leadership in quantum technologies.</p><p>3. Provide comprehensive support to Flagship projects, researchers, and innovators, fostering synergies, knowledge sharing, and best practices.</p><p>4. Develop and implement targeted communication strategies to raise awareness and understanding of quantum technologies across varied audiences, including students, specialists, and the general public.</p><p>6. Promote the sustainable growth of quantum technologies in Europe by exploring new applications and markets, ensuring the field's dynamism and competitiveness.</p><p>7. Serve as a pivotal entity for coordinating efforts between the EU and Member States, especially in light of the new Quantum Declaration. This includes aligning national and European strategies and enhancing international relations to fortify Europe's stance in the global quantum landscape.</p><p>8. Assist the Flagship's governance bodies and facilitate the integration of new structures or initiatives, ensuring a cohesive and efficient approach to advancing quantum technologies in Europe.</p><p>9. Act as a globally-oriented data observatory for quantum technologies, systematically collecting data (e.g. on patents, scientific publications and the current and future evolution of markets for quantum technologies) related to the state of quantum technologies in Europe and worldwide. Once or twice a year, this data should be disseminated to stakeholders, including the Commission and Member States, as well as countries associated to Horizon Europe.</p><p>10. Propose a clear, service-oriented model detailing the CSA's offerings to various stakeholders, including research support, data business intelligence, strategic analysis, international collaboration facilitation, event organization, and communication activities.</p><p>11. Update the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda through a community-based process involving research and industry stakeholders.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The scope of the new Quantum Flagship CSA encompasses:</p><p>1. The global observatory role of quantum technologies, systematically reporting on the latest advancements and breakthroughs occurring worldwide.</p><p>2. Fulfil the dissemination requirement of five articles every two months highlighting EU success stories in quantum technologies. These articles should be widely promoted in Europe and beyond via social media, popular newspapers, and technical magazines to ensure maximum visibility and impact.</p><p>3. Building upon the established infrastructure by the previous CSA, support the European Commission and current and future projects within the Quantum Flagship, including organisation of events and ensuring they have access to the necessary resources and expertise.</p><p>4. Developing comprehensive communication plans tailored to different target audiences, enhancing the visibility and understanding of quantum technologies and their societal implications.</p><p>5. Acting as a central hub for coordinating actions between the EU, Member States, and international partners. This involves compiling and disseminating information critical for harmonizing strategies at different levels.</p><p>6. Providing support to the Flagship's governance structures, contributing to the smooth execution of its strategic vision and operational goals. This may include aiding the establishment and integration of new bodies or initiatives.</p><p>7. Contribute to the organisation of the European Quantum Technologies Conference (EQTC). The conference is due to be hosted by the country holding the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the third quarter of each year (2026-2029).</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals with an overall duration of typically 48 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations.</p><p>The project should aim to link to the activities of relevant standards development organisations with e.g. participation of project beneficiaries in the relevant standards technical committees. The Commission encourages the inclusion of partners with direct experience <s> </s>of participation in relevant standards committees at national, European or international level(s) in project consortia.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to build on, or seek collaboration with, existing projects and develop synergies and complementarities with other relevant European, national, or regional initiatives and funding programmes. In particular, links are encouraged with:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>the project funded under the topic HORIZON-CL4-2021-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01-32: Support and coordination of the Quantum Technologies Flagship Initiative (CSA) – QUCATS project;</li><li>all relevant quantum technologies-related projects funded under Horizon Europe and Digital Europe, and as part of the EuroQCI initiative, EuroHPC Joint Undertaking and Chips Joint Undertaking.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should also cover synergies with other relevant European, national, or regional initiatives and funding programmes such as those mentioned above.</p><p>Proposals should also contribute to spreading excellence across Europe; for example, through the involvement of EU Widening Countries.</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and/or gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement; however, should proposers consider it to be of relevance for their proposal, they are strongly encouraged to integrate it.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Establishing a universal, interoperable quantum computing ecosystem that supports diverse hardware platforms through the creation of a technology-agnostic software stack.</li><li>Seamlessly integrating quantum computing with classical computing systems, including HPC and cloud services (including the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking’s supercomputers, and the quantum computers and simulators already integrated into them), and demonstrating practical quantum computing applications by showcasing use cases that combine quantum and classical computing capabilities</li><li>Advancing the development of standardized software architectures, compilers, and simulators that ensure application portability and performance across different quantum computing platforms.</li><li>Demonstration of workflows that effectively combine quantum and classical computing to address complex computational challenges, providing clear examples of the added value of quantum acceleration or showing a quantum advantage.</li><li>Support for initiatives aimed at training software developers in quantum programming and developing libraries for basic quantum algorithms, including the integration of quantum error correction mechanisms.</li> </ol><p>This topic emphasizes the strategic importance of collaboration between Horizon Europe quantum computing software and hardware projects and the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking’s quantum projects, including high-performance computing-quantum middleware, integration, and Quantum Excellence Centres. Successful applicants will be required to closely collaborate and agree on the interfaces for the main layers of the software stack at the beginning of their projects. It is crucial that the projects collaborate from the outset to define open interfaces for the main layers of the software stack. These interfaces should be open for consultation and incorporate input from existing initiatives to ensure they are well aligned with current developments in the field. All interface specifications should be properly documented as they will serve as the foundational basis for the development of different layers and facilitate seamless collaboration across projects.</p><p>In line with the European Commission’s commitment to open access and reuse of software, when possible, all developments under this call should utilize open-source software platforms and be published in open repositories such as GitHub. Additionally, the use of appropriate software licenses, such as those listed as free by the Free Software Foundation and listed as open source by the Open Source Initiative, or under the European Union Public Licence (EUPL), is strongly recommended.</p><p>Moreover, the beneficiaries will have to ensure open access to other research outputs like data and workflows under the principle ‘as open as possible and as closed as necessary’ and in accordance with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Quantum APIs and cloud access form the transition layer between users and quantum machines in the quantum computation stack. This layer includes general-purpose quantum software development kits that are used to implement quantum algorithms for both gate-based systems, simulators and quantum annealers. This call seeks proposals that address the creation of a cohesive software stack that is agnostic to quantum hardware, facilitating the development, testing, and deployment of quantum applications across various platforms.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to build on, or seek collaboration with, existing projects, and develop synergies and ensure complementarities with other relevant European, national, or regional initiatives and funding programmes. In particular, links are encouraged with the following, as well as with the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>HORIZON-CL4-2021-DIGITAL-EMERGING-02-17: Framework Partnership Agreement for developing large-scale quantum simulation platform technologies (FPA)</li><li>HORIZON-CL4-2021-DIGITAL-EMERGING-02-15: Framework Partnership Agreement for developing the first large-scale quantum computers (FPA)</li><li>HORIZON-CL4-2023-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01-43: Framework Partnership Agreement for developing large-scale quantum Computing platform technologies (FPA)</li><li>HORIZON-CL4-QUANTUM-02-SGA - Developing large-scale quantum simulation platform technologies (SGA)</li><li>HORIZON-CL4-QUANTUM-01-SGA - Developing the first large-scale quantum computers (SGA)</li> </ul><p>In addition, proposals are expected to develop synergies with relevant projects funded under the Digital Europe Programme (DEP).</p><p>Proposals should also contribute to spreading excellence across Europe; for example, through the involvement of EU Widening Countries.</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and/or gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement; however, should proposers consider it to be of relevance for their proposal, they are strongly encouraged to integrate it.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Creation of the GenAI4EU HUB: developing a strong and visible GenAI4EU community, supporting the uptake of European GenAI solutions across strategic application sectors and the HE Clusters, through collaboration and knowledge exchange.</li><li>This CSA will also support and collaborate with the European Commission’s AI Office in its function to promote an innovative ecosystem of trustworthy AI, to reap the societal and economic benefits.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This horizontal Coordination and Support Action for GenAI4EU will develop a strong and visible European GenAI ecosystem of developers and users, aiming to strengthen the coordination, impact and visibility of the GenAI4EU initiative<sup>[1]</sup> across diverse sectors. This CSA should be prepared, managed and coordinated by the key stakeholders in this field, in particular those active in developing local GenAI communities, tech transfer, attracting investment, and making the European GenAI stakeholders visible.</p><p>Serving as a hub for collaboration, this project seeks to streamline efforts in developing high-impact GenAI-based applications while fostering cooperation among various GenAI stakeholders, from startups, academia and large user industries, including large IT suppliers and integrators.</p><p>It will support all the Horizon Europe Pillar 2 clusters, in addressing their policy needs through the implementation of the GenAI4EU initiative, in particular in supporting mechanisms to pool efficiently and make sufficient data of high quality available (in particular from the European Data Spaces, but exploiting other sources of data as appropriate), and facilitate collaboration with the AI Factories.</p><p>The proposed project is expected to involve close collaboration and coordination among the projects implementing GenAI4EU, developing a strong community. It should also help them to maximise their impact and increase their visibility.</p><p>It should also foster the uptake in all strategic application sectors, namely the ones addressed in the GenAI4EU initiative, including the 14 industrial ecosystems<sup>[2]</sup>, in stimulating collaborations between the European developers and users.</p><p>The selected proposal will foster collaboration between the AI Factories, the Data Spaces (as well as other data providers) and the SIMPL infrastructure, in establishing mechanisms to make data available in the AI factories, in particular for the training, and possibly fine-tuning of large GenAI models, while respecting IP or privacy/GDPR of the entities/industries providing their data. This should build on relevant initiatives, such as data intermediation services, with a view of using a trusted third party to ensure no exchanges between industry competitors for instance, while defining mechanisms to access (and if needed pooling of) critical amount of data, required for the training of very large models. This will require mobilisation of industries owning large sets of data, defining with them such mechanisms acceptable to all, and implementing them through secure infrastructures, protocols, interoperability mechanisms, within the various projects implementing GenAI4EU in the various clusters.</p><p>The proposal will also support Common European Data Spaces to coordinate standard setting approaches for further data sharing and data interoperability among them or with the AI Factories.</p><p>The selected proposal will also ensure collaboration between the GenAI4EU projects, and the relevant the AI Factories, for the computing resources, and the data spaces. Moreover, a few specific working groups among stakeholders should be established in key European industrial / application sectors (such as in Robotics / Manufacturing, Automotive, energy, pharmaceuticals, etc.). Their aim will be to bring together key stakeholders of the sector (incl. startups / SMEs and large companies) and foster discussions among them for stimulating their cooperation in developing GenAI models relevant for their sector, but also on how to address access to existing large data sets, incl. their interoperability and use for GenAI models and/or any other elements necessary for enabling an effective development and further grow of the sector’s GenAI ecosystem.</p><p>The proposal will also ensure connection with the AI on Demand platform providing support for fine-tuning pre-trained models and developing innovative downstream applications, the GenAI4EU Skills, and relevant activities implemented under the EU’s Digital Europe Programme, Horizon Europe Programme as well as national activities. The selected proposal is also expected to build on or seek collaboration with existing and upcoming projects and develop synergies and ensure complementarities with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms.</p><p>The CSA is expected to constantly monitor the way the EU GenAI ecosystem, including the AI factories, is developing. More broadly, the selected proposal will act as a global observatory for GenAI conducting a comprehensive landscape analysis of GenAI, including data on market, research, funding, patent and more broadly the state of the advancement of GenAI in the EU and worldwide. This includes an inventory of use cases, capabilities, evaluation tools and methods to assess generative AI models. The selected proposal is expected to widely disseminate this analysis at least twice a year to the stakeholders, including the EU, the Member States and Associated Countries.</p><p>It will also assess the uptake of GenAI by large European industry (including technology suppliers and user industry), and mobilise them to engage in GenAI4EU initiatives and drive the future strategy for the development and uptake of GenAI solution “made in Europe” in all strategic industries.</p><p>By identifying prioritized sectors and sharing best practices, the project aims to bridge existing gaps, connect stakeholders and foster innovation uptake.</p><p>Furthermore, the selected proposal will assess potential areas that require further R&amp;D, including coordination with national initiatives, to ensure comprehensive coverage and collaboration. It will actively engage in networking and community animation to foster knowledge exchange and collaboration among stakeholders.</p><p>When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&amp;D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data and robotics (ADRA) and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with ADRA and the funded actions related to this partnership under the call CSA HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-02. This initiative will capitalise on these existing initiatives, complement them and ensure integration within the existing ecosystem developed by ADRA.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <u>https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/communication-boosting-startups-and-innovation-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence</u></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] The 14 strategic industrial ecosystems identified in the European Industrial strategy (Strategy - European Commission (europa.eu)) are: construction, digital industries, health, agri-food, renewables, energy intensive industries, transport and automotive, electronics, textile, aerospace and defence, cultural and creative culture industries, tourism, proximity and social economy, and retail</p>"

Proposal results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Support structure for the European Computing ecosystem: networking events (including conferences, summer schools etc.) and vision workshops for the academic and industrial computing community;</li><li>Yearly updated roadmaps on computing addressing the area from a broad perspective from edge-IoT device to edge cloud to cloud to HPC, from scientific to industrial to societal and research applications, and addressing all relevant aspects such as real-time, security, support to artificial intelligence, use of generative AI for computing system engineering, etc.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>To support the European Commission and the European computing constituency by providing to them annually updated roadmaps for research and innovation related to computing. This topic is overarching and building the bridge between Destinations 3 (heading “From Cloud to Edge to IoT for European Data”), Destination 4 (“Ultra Low Power Processors”), as well as the Joint Undertakings (JU) on Chips, Smart Networks and Services, and high-performance computing (HPC). This effort builds on the achievements and structures established by the HIPEAC project and think tank of renowned European research centres on computing “at large” and their key experts. Both the academic visions as well as the industrial perspective complementing the Strategic Research and Innovation Agendas of the JUs as well as the roadmapping done by the European Alliance for Industrial Data, Edge &amp; Cloud as well as the IPCEI exploitation office should be taken into consideration.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Demonstrated added value of Innovative Advanced materials (IAMs) such as Two-dimensional materials and EO polymers for integrated photonic devices and systems, with focus on low power consumption, enabling future telecommunication networks in which Europe can build competitive value chains.</li><li>IAMs for miniaturized and outperforming photonic integrated technologies e.g. in terms of performance, power, cost, novel functionality enabling the development of future-proof, scalable, low-power and high-bandwidth devices.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>IAMs can be the ideal candidate for several applications in photonics and optoelectronics. These include ultrafast integrated photonic circuits, with modulators, waveguides, detectors, emitters and switches, which play a crucial role in the ongoing quest to increase the speed of data transmission in telecommunications networks. In addition, they find utility in high-frequency transmitter modulators and receiver demodulators, which are essential for advancing wireless telecommunications technologies. They can also serve as integral components in optical interconnects for data centers, high-performance computing (HPCs), and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) computing systems.</p><p>The main objective of this topic is to explore innovative solutions based on IAMs, including 2DMs, that offer state-of-the-art performance and low power consumption, while demonstrating scalability for volume production, thus exploiting the semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure. The envisioned compact devices are expected to be designed to be compatible with low-power driving electronics and thus reduce energy consumption. Solutions should be compatible with existing photonic integrated platforms and low-voltage electronics.</p><p>Proposals are expected to integrate the value chain and include relevant manufacturing technologies required to bring the developed devices to market. Prototypes are expected to be developed using packaged devices, including electronics, to enable testing in relevant environments.</p><p>Efforts should be focused on envisioning optimized routes for electronic and photonic design, fabricating photonic circuits, producing IAMs, conducting testing, executing wafer-scale fabrication, and performing co-integration and co-packaging, ultimately leading to demonstrations of the developed technologies and their added values.</p><p>Where relevant, proposers are encouraged to take advantage of and connecting to European analytical research infrastructures and services such as the ones in the ARIE network <sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p>Proposals should also consider building their innovations on top of relevant existing standards and consider standardisation as part of innovation and dissemination activities.</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership Innovative Advanced Materials for Europe (IAM4EU). Proposals funded under this topic are part of the IAM4EU partnership portfolio and are expected to develop synergies with the related stakeholder community and contribute actively to the objectives of the partnership. Proposals should seek collaboration, with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national, or regional initiatives, funding programmes such as the Graphene Flagship <sup>[2]</sup> for proposals investigating 2D materials. In addition, outreach to relevant national projects in EU Member States and Associated Countries is encouraged. Adequate resources for all these synergies should be foreseen in the proposal.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] https://arie-eu.org/</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] Graphene Flagship: https://graphene-flagship.eu/</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Easing the compliance process of businesses and professionals with the relevant EU legislation, in particular reporting obligations, and alleviating administrative burdens for businesses and professionals.</li><li>Developing and integrating advanced technologies for data collection, data sharing and data analytics for simplifying and automating compliance.</li><li>Generating, managing, and leveraging synthetic data to improve fitness for purpose; addressing limitations of real-world data, enhancing data quality, diversity, and representativeness, while mitigating bias and addressing other ethical issues.</li><li>Ensuring broad user training and support for rolling out and scaling up “compliance and privacy by design” and the FAIR<sup>[1]</sup> principles in the constantly evolving regulatory landscape.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>As the European Union (EU) legislation continues to expand, both in the digital (GDPR, Open Data Directive (ODD), Data Governance Act, AI Act, Data Act) and non-digital realm (e.g. green deal, due diligence, healthcare, transport), businesses and professionals face increasing challenges in maintaining compliance. Also, the complexity and volume of reporting obligations are growing, posing difficulties for both regulatory bodies to enforce laws and for entities trying to comply. These challenges underscore the need for innovative solutions to streamline compliance processes and enhance competitiveness within the EU.</p><p>Another current challenge are limitations of real-world data such as issues with availability, confidentiality, and bias. Synthetic data is becoming increasingly vital in addressing these problems. By generating and utilizing synthetic data, actions within this framework aim to enhance data quality, diversity, and representativeness, making it a crucial tool for AI-powered innovation and regulatory compliance.</p><p>Where relevant, the actions should address <strong>cybersecurity, interoperability, reproducibility and standardization</strong>, and/or liaise with other actions working on those aspects, in view of facilitating effective data sharing across platforms and sectors, while ensuring an adequate level of security and protection.</p><p>Actions should provide necessary comprehensive <strong>user training and support</strong>, (also involving the users/stakeholders outside the project), ensuring adaptability and scalability to accommodate evolving regulations and diverse organizational needs and to raise awareness and improve understanding of relevant compliance issues. Proposals for all three areas should analyse and address the real needs of real users and stakeholders, and how these will be addressed in the proposed action. The training and user needs should be linked to tangible progress indicators in the proposal.</p><p>The proposal should clearly state (in the abstract and in the introduction) which of the following three areas it addresses. A proposal can address more than one area, but it should indicate one of them as the main focus of the proposal, and it will be evaluated accordingly under that area.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Area 1: Actions to develop advanced compliance technology integrating AI, cybersecurity, language technologies, and privacy preservation. This framework could include the creation of NLP<sup>[2]</sup>-driven semantic analysis tools for deciphering complex legal texts and translating them into clear compliance tasks, energy-efficient neuromorphic approaches and mechanisms for optimising massive data operations, or machine learning algorithms trained on historical data to predict and mitigate potential compliance violations. With the capability to detect changes in EU legislation, these advanced AI systems and analytics tools will provide deep insights into compliance performance, risk management, and help forecast upcoming regulatory trends to strategically prepare for future requirements. For usability, it is also important that the tools can be integrated with the organisation’s existing processes and systems.</li><li>Area 2: Actions to ensure auto-compliance of data transactions and data spaces with applicable regulation (e.g. data and sectoral legislation). Actions in this area should anticipate compliance tasks within the context of Common European Data Spaces and coordinate with them as necessary. Actions in this area are expected to develop automatic or semi-automatic tools that analyse and take into account the specific architecture, governance model, exchange mechanisms, tools, data types, identity management, smart contracting, user policies and other user needs or operational features of the actual data spaces, liaising with and building on other actions working in this area, in particular the Data Spaces Support Centre.</li><li>Area 3: Actions to generate, manage and leverage <strong>sy</strong>nthetic data in order to improve data quality, availability, representativity, fitness for purpose and compliance. The actions should in particular address the inherent shortcomings of real world data that would necessitate synthetic data (e.g. data availability, confidentiality, privacy protection, enhancing quality, diversity, representativeness, bias). Additionally, actions may target generating synthetic data for sparse or unusual domains, integrating synthetic and real data effectively, or advancing technological capabilities in generative models and simulation-based approaches to drive synthetic data generation forward and/or addressing or modelling rare events and complex dynamic systems. All actions under this Area are expected to address the evaluation, validation and benchmarking of synthetic data to ensure fitness for purpose and safe, ethical and compliant use of synthetic data, including the analysis and mitigation of biases inherited from the original data or introduced by the synthetic data generation process. For these purposes, collaboration with simulation/digital twins actions could be explored.</li> </ul><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, Data and Robotics.</p><p>Projects are expected to develop synergies with Digital Europe programme topics implementing Common European Data Spaces, especially the Data Spaces Support Centre (DSSC). Projects are expected to ensure complementarities with projects funded under the following topics:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>HORIZON-CL4-2024-DATA-01-01 AI-driven data operations and compliance technologies (IA).</li><li>HORIZON-CL4-2021-DATA-01-01 Technologies and solutions for compliance, privacy preservation, green and responsible data operations (RIA).</li> </ul><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable data</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] NLP: Natural Language Processing</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Defining specific R&amp;I roadmap at EU level to enhance the cooperation between the EU authorities and other stakeholders and establish leadership in all relevant submarine cable technology domains (EU research roadmap on submarine cables infrastructures, i.e. including any infrastructure related to its construction, operation, maintenance and repair). This CSA should be prepared, managed and coordinated by the key stakeholders in this field, including industry, research and academic stakeholders.</p><p>Τhe project should take into consideration the overarching challenges of:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Reinforcing European leadership and cooperation in submarine cable connectivity, with European capabilities and best practices shaping future connectivity standards, promoting their secondary use (e.g. for a pre-warning system of natural hazard) as well as synergies and collaboration with CEF-Digital backbone projects;</li><li>A digital and green transition towards low carbon footprint of connectivity platforms through principles of the circular economy, including reduction of pollution, regenerating natural systems etc. while targeting long-term sustainability, resilience and security of submarine cable networks;</li><li>Ensuring resilience for the most demanding cases requiring a very high grade of quality of service (QoS) and performances, and</li><li>Risk evaluation, preparedness and prevention against any future natural or man-made damage or deliberate sabotage.</li> </ul><p>Against this background, the objectives of the target support actions are outlined below:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Analysis and definition of the expected critical hardware and software components of future submarine cable infrastructure systems, and indication on where Europe should seize opportunities and strengthen its capabilities, taking into account the characteristics and architectures, including components, security, and operations of future submarine connectivity infrastructures;</li><li>Definition of the main required R&amp;I work and assessment of associated research investment needs related to the identified domains;</li><li>Definition of an appropriate industry roadmap (SRIA), in close partnership with relevant EU actors both from industry and academia, indicating research &amp; innovation actions to be undertaken in priority, their scope, and a timetable showing the main milestones and targets. The project could envisage organising thematic workshops to consult all interested communities. The results of this action will feed into the work of relevant groups working on submarine cable infrastructures, such as the European Submarine Cable Expert Group, the NIS 2 Coordination Group or the CER Group.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enabling technologies applicable to submarine connectivity infrastructures and systems, including its secondary use for pre-warning systems against natural hazards, are increasingly important to ensure Europe’s strategic autonomy as well as economic security. Achieving such goals requires that Europe remains at the technological edge not only with regards to the cable technology itself but also all the other critical elements composing the submarine cable infrastructure such as repeaters, landings stations, operational control centres, underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASN) or cable communications cybersecurity.</li><li>While some of the necessary research is indirectly conducted through mainstream research activities in generic technologies (e.g., optical communications or network management software), more specific research is needed to address the particular needs and advancement of submarine cable infrastructures and systems. However, the specific research needs still need to be identified, which supports the need to develop a specific roadmap and SRIA for research and innovation in submarine cable technologies. Such research efforts may address some of the following (non-exhaustive) domains: Multi-core fibre (MCF) technology, Digital Signal Processing, repeater systems, intelligent sensing, advanced Digital Acoustic Sensing (DAS), strain and temperature sensing, oceanographic sensors for continuous, real-time trans-oceanic measurements (monitor water body), logical layer and cable network management systems, underwater robotics to improve the construction, maintenance and repair of submarine cable infrastructures, and other innovations, such as wireless sensor networks (WSN) to monitor permanently submarine cable infrastructure and to detect possible threats.</li> </ul><p>Projects are expected to develop synergies and ensure complementarities with projects under CEF Digital, the Digital Europe Programme (DEP) and the Smart Networks and Services (SNS) Joint Undertaking. <strong><u> </u></strong></p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Proposals are expected to contribute to developing core technologies for Virtual Worlds, with a focus on better, more realistic and more performant interaction and immersion, at application and components levels. The following outcomes are expected:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Area A: Better and more realistic immersion through multimodal interaction. Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Improvement of the multimodal immersion experience combining eXtended Reality with advanced and innovative technologies.</li>   </ul> </li><li>Area B: Innovative photonics technologies for projection, sensing and perception in virtual worlds. Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Improved performance of microdisplays or sensing devices serving Virtual Worlds by using innovative Optics and Photonics technologies.</li>   </ul> </li> </ul><p>Proposals are expected to focus on either Area A or Area B. The area should be clearly identified within the proposal. Special attention will be given to proposals (whether Area A or Area B) including transdisciplinary research in order to deliver and enhance uptake of suitable, accurate, ethical and safe solutions.</p><p>Proposed applications should aim at increasing awareness, acceptance and adoption of virtual worlds applications across sectors.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Virtual worlds will impact the way people live, work, create and share content, the way public administrations interact with citizens as well as the way businesses operate, innovate, produce and interact with customers.</p><p>Multimodal interaction and immersion are key dimensions of Virtual Worlds and will be supported by innovative optics and photonics technologies to achieve the full potential of Virtual Worlds core technologies.</p><p>A broader adoption of Virtual Worlds will need better and more realistic immersion and interaction, mixing modalities, sensors and actuators for an ever-improved user experience: touch, smell, haptics, etc will be better stimulated, bringing users closer to real-world sensations, serving Virtual Worlds.</p><p>Many challenges remain to be addressed to realize optics and photonics technical solutions that offer high-performance, excellent visual quality, high-quality user experience, and sustainable services and devices, for head-mounted displays (HMD), autostereoscopic displays or sensing devices.</p><p>Coupled with display and sensing technologies, algorithms and metrics should be considered to exploit the underlying light (transportation) models given the utilized modality and address e.g. scene representation, content generation, compression, transmission, content reconstruction, content-to-display adaptation, or rendering. Moreover, the quality of integration, both from a user and technological perspective, will be essential for a broad adoption of Virtual Worlds.</p><p>The Area A proposals under this topic should develop and demonstrate novel applications for Virtual Worlds that combine several modalities and aim to provide seamless and more realistic immersive interactions. Proposals should investigate novel scientific approaches or push the limit of existing ones to improve the synchronization and integration of the different modalities.</p><p>Proposals should focus on an enhanced use of multimodal technologies, integrating at least two modalities within an extended reality application. Modalities include haptics and force-feedback, vision, touch, smell, speech, etc.</p><p>The Area B proposals should address the development and integration of advanced innovative and high-performance Optics and Photonics technologies for display and sensing devices serving Virtual Worlds.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>For displays further improve current high-end microdisplays regarding power consumption (&lt;1 mW), device efficiency, resolution (8K and beyond, pixel densities &gt; 10kppi), high dynamic range (HDR), colour gamut, contrast and refresh rate holding the promise for truly immersive experiences;</li><li>For sensing devices improve accuracy in diverse lighting conditions and with different eye physiologies.</li> </ul><p>Special attention should be given to the design and fabrication of suited waveguide optics, holographic elements, diffractive optics, reflective light guides, freeform optics (including micro-optics), or meta-surfaces with optimal optical properties and behaviour; to support the required field of view (FoV), to be lightweight and safe for the user, and provide excellent colour uniformity and high brightness efficiency; to satisfy the use case requirements for both professional use and mass adoption, i.e., be scalable to large volumes and cost-effective; to integrate targeted systems seamlessly into mixed-reality devices without increasing bulk or reducing comfort.</p><p>For both Area A and Area B proposals, the quality of integration, both from a user and technological perspective, will be essential for a broad adoption of Virtual Worlds. The proposals should include a focus on human perception and experience, from subjective<u>,</u> objective, and functional perspectives, and take into account EU values such as inclusivity, privacy, security and safety of users and the protection of their personal data, as well as diversity. Solutions should guarantee the privacy and rights of individuals and companies and ensure secure and trustworthy interactions to deliver and enhance uptake of suitable, accurate, ethical and safe solutions.</p><p>The Consortium should pay attention to developing solutions that are reliable, robust and interoperable. Proposals should leverage existing open standards and technologies in the domain of eXtended Reality, while contributing to ongoing standardisation work. Applications should be tested and anchored in real world environments and aimed at least one application domain.</p><p>We consider that proposals with an overall duration of typically 36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations.</p><p>Proposals should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines and SSH experts, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>This topic is implemented through a joint effort from the co-programmed European Partnership for Virtual Worlds and the Photonics Partnership and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with both partnerships, including the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-17: Specific support for the Virtual Worlds Partnership and the Web 4.0 initiative.</p>"

          "<p><strong>Our software supply chains are a silent miracle</strong>, the result of millions of hours spent every year packaging, compiling and distributing software. From this vast firehose of bits come the apps and services we depend on every day. Subsequently, billions of hours are spent by users on dealing with everything from <em>simple updates</em> to <em>complex system administration</em>. This vast effort is necessary to keep oneself abreast of the never-ending supply of potential vulnerabilities that arrives with just a slight delay. Users that fail to responsively track new releases of every deployed service and each of its dependencies, are bound to land themselves or others in trouble sooner rather than later.</p><p>Deploying internet based services is much tougher than we can afford. No matter how user friendly or well-written software is, enabling the community at large to maintain internet services by themselves at scale has proven to be consistently challenging. Achieving <strong>high availability</strong> scenario's is even more of a dark art. No wonder, people just give in and surrender their data.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.fediversity.eu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fediversity</a></strong> is a comprehensive effort to bring easy-to-use, hosted cloud services with <strong>service portability</strong> and <strong>personal freedom</strong> at their core to everyone. It wants to provide everyone with high-quality, secure IT systems for everyday use. Without tracking, without exploitation, in a way that runs everywhere and scales effortlessly. Fediversity is based on <a href=\"https://nixos.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NixOS</a>, a disruptive Linux distribution with a unique approach to package and configuration management. Built on top of the Nix package manager, NixOS is completely declarative, makes upgrading systems reliable, and has many other advantages. Because it is <a href=\"https://reproducible-builds.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reproducible</a>, it is ideally suited for <strong>complex deployment scenario</strong>'s where consistent behaviour, stability and configurability matter.</p><p>One such \"complex\" deployment scenario is running state-of-the-art services for the Fediverse, like <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/PeerTube\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PeerTube</a>, <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/Mastodon/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mastodon</a>, <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/Owncast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Owncast</a> or <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/Lemmy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lemmy</a> — especially if you want to for instance add services like <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/Peertube-Livechat/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">live chat</a> or <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/Peertube-Transcode/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">transcoding</a>. But even running more traditional services like <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/Aerogramme\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">modern</a> <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/Stalwart\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">e-mail</a> <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/Mox\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">servers</a> with possible <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/Lightmeter/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">whistles</a> and <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/EmailXMPPgateway/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bells</a> can be daunting. The same holds for deploying a <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/eduvpn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">VPN</a>, <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/NextCloudSearch/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">private cloud storage</a>, <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/WikiActivityPub/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wiki</a>, etc. Fediversity will enable all of these use cases, and more — finally bringing these to the market in a way that is as conveient as using a hosted service.</p><p>Fediversity will deliver an ambitious development effort, but this is a vast domain with many more challenges than what any preconceived effort could tackle by itself. <strong>This is why we invite your contribution</strong> to help us reshape the state of play, and together create an <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/fediversity/#NGI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">open, trustworthy and reliable internet for all</a>.</p><p><strong>This is your opportunity to make a real difference</strong>. You tell us how your project can help Fediversity go harder, better, faster, stronger. In order to enable you to make such contributions, we will award <strong>450 000 euro</strong> in small to medium-size R&D grants towards solutions that bring the next generation of mobile solutions closer. We are seeking project proposals <strong>between 5.000 and 50.000 euro's</strong> — which should get you on your way. If the project works out well you can subsequently scale up in other programmes funded by NLnet such as <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/commonsfund\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NGI0 Commons Fund</a>. Noteworthy fact: many projects which are to be deployed inside Fediversity were themselves bootstrapped on precisely such a grant from NGI, and now it is your turn.</p>"

          "<p><a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/commonsfund\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NGI0 Commons Fund</a>, co-funded from the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 101135429, foresees as an eligible activity the provision of financial support to third parties, as a means to achieve the objectives of the Next Generation Internet initiative and to contribute to a resilient, trustworthy and sustainably open internet.</p><p><br></p><p>It is clear that the <em>commons</em> model works, and continues to gain ground. Free and open source <strong>software</strong> and <strong>hardware</strong>, open <strong>standards</strong>, open <strong>data & AI</strong>, open <strong>science</strong>, <strong>creative commons</strong> and open <strong>educational resources</strong> are democratising innovation and learning, and are together driving society and industry forward at an unprecedented pace. But it is also obvious that there are major gaps that need to be fixed still. The answer to market failure and dystopian runaway technology lies in <strong>collective action</strong> and <strong>public investment</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>This is where <strong>NGI Zero Commons Fund</strong> come into play. The goal of this new fund is to help deliver, mature and scale <strong>new internet commons</strong> across the whole technology spectrum, from libre silicon to middleware, from P2P infrastructure to convenient end user applications. We have a <strong>holistic</strong>, <strong>full-stack approach</strong>, simply because there is no other way. If we want to reclaim the public nature of the internet and yield the full benefits from technology as a society, we need to have full coverage — period.</p><p><br></p><p>Only though enough critical mass of <strong>shared building blocks</strong> and <strong>collective resources</strong> will our governments, businesses and civil society be able to secure their security and long term operational availability. The same approach that empowers individuals to take full control of their digital lives, will also steer towards more fair, innovative economies and societies. So let's make it happen!</p><p><br></p><p>The changes we want to see are vast, and there is much technical debt to resolve as well. We are looking for <strong>troubleshooters</strong> that help society tackle the hard but very very important challenges ahead. Ultimately we believe in the power of the <strong>quadruple helix</strong> — the collaboration of the public sector, aligned companies, academia and civil society — to restore the internet (and our economies) back to health. Together we can create a strong and open internet for all, and bring about new paradigms like the European Commissions vision for <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/virtual-worlds-and-web-40-factsheet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Web 4.0</a> which aim to harness upcoming techologies like <em>virtual and augmented reality</em>, <em>generative AI</em> and <em>intelligent mediators</em> in a responsible way so they may sustainably serve society.</p><p><br></p><p>We need <strong>new ideas</strong> and <strong>disruptive technologies</strong>, while at the same time <strong>evolving</strong> and <strong>growing</strong> existing technologies that are still future-proof.</p><p><br></p><p>Have a look at <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/thema/NGIZeroPET.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">other</a> <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/thema/NGIZeroDiscovery.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NGI</a> <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/thema/NGI0Entrust.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zero </a><a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/thema/NGIZeroCore.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">programmes</a> to see the kind of efforts we mean, but don't be afraid to send something completely different if you think you can contribute to the topic — it really is an open call.</p><p><br></p><p>Project results always become available under a free or open source license, so anyone can read and validate the source code, and anyone can use the code or open data to create solutions that fits their own purposes. The right to reuse and right to repair not only allow for unrestricted scrutiny and permissionless innovation, but also help to reduce e-waste.

          "<p>In the digital economy, payments play a critical role. Yet online payment systems tend to allow for far less privacy than paying with a bank note or coins, especially when using proprietary solutions like Google Pay or Apple Pay. When interacting with the offline economy comes into play, the alternative of paying with all kind of volatile cryptocurrencies isn't a viable option either.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NGI TALER</strong> is a project funded by the <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/taler/#ack\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">European Commission</a> and the <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/taler/#ack\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Swiss State</a> to roll out a <strong>new electronic payment system</strong> that benefits everyone: people, merchants, banks, financial authorities, auditors and anti-corruption researchers. The project doesn't have to start from scratch either, but builds on the strong foundations of <strong><a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/GNUTaler\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GNU Taler</a></strong> — the privacy-preserving digital payment system developed by the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GNU community</a> and <a href=\"https://taler-systems.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Taler Systems SA</a>. This offers privacy for those that make payments, while enforcing transparency on those that sell. By providing <strong>micro payments</strong> at <strong>very low overhead</strong>, GNU Taler permits internet business models to shift away from advertising revenue or subscription models, especially for online publishers. <strong>No-risk transactions</strong> can lower transaction fees and open online payments for the underbanked population and citizens marginalized from digitalisation.</p><p><br></p><p>Part of the budget of NGI TALER (15% to be precise) is reserved for <strong>open calls</strong> to fund <strong>additional</strong> free and open source efforts that are aligned with the topics and approach of NGI TALER. We invite your contributions to help reshape the state of play of <strong>digital payment systems</strong>, and to help create an <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/taler/#NGI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">open, trustworthy and reliable internet for all</a>. Of course you can contribute exciting <strong>new capabilities</strong> to GNU Taler itself, build <strong>auxiliary tools</strong> or work on <strong>user experience</strong>, but you could also be developing <strong>integrations</strong> into FOSS applications and open standards (enabling P2P micropayments in for instance an instant messenger, open social media platform or video conferencing tool), or work on improvements to <strong>infrastructure components</strong> like merchant backends. Together with the rest of the <a href=\"https://ngi.eu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Next Generation Internet</a> initiative, we move towards restoring and subsequently maintaining European sovereignty and to secure democratic ownership of our digital societies.</p><p><br></p><p>In order to enable you to make such contributions, we will award up to<strong> 396 000 euro</strong> in small to medium-size R&D grants towards technology commons that empower users, and establish a new generation of privacy-friendly digital payments systems. The programme will run between now and November 2026, but budgets are limited — so grab your opportunity.</p><p><br></p><p>Project results must be made available under a free and open source license, so anyone can read and validate the source code, and anyone can use the code to create technology that fits their own purposes. We are seeking project proposals <strong>between 5.000 and 50.000 euro's</strong> — if the project works out well you can subsequently scale up in other programmes funded by NLnet such as <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/core\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NGI0 Core</a>. Reliable, low-cost, secure and resource efficient payments should become the 'new normal' of the internet, something ordinary users should not have to worry about — users should be in control. So let's make it happen. <strong>Note that GNU Taler itself was <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/GNUTaler\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">funded</a> <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/GNUTaler-KYC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">through</a> <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/GNUTaler-LocalCurrencies\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">such</a> <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/Taler-iOS-wallet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Next Generation Internet</a> <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/RSA-PQ-BlindSignatures\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">projects</a>, so there is every opportunity to grow.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Through the open calls, we assist independent researchers and developers to join in and create powerful new technologies and put these in the hands of future generations as building blocks for a fair and democratic society. Help us build a sustainable and open economy that benefits all, and <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/propose\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">submit your idea today</a>. Not sure whether your idea fits? Don't be afraid to send something completely out-of-the-box if you think you can contribute to the topic (and it fits with the <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/taler/eligibility\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">eligibility criteria</a>): <strong>it really is an open call</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Want to <a href=\"https://taler.net\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">learn more about Taler</a> before you submit a proposal, or have other questions? Take a look at the GNU Taler <a href=\"https://taler.net\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">technology</a>, the main <a href=\"https://taler.net/en/ngi-taler.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NGI Taler</a> site - or join the <a href=\"https://ich.taler.net/och\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GNU Taler Integration Community Hub</a> to have a chat about your ideas.</p>"

MSCA Doctoral Networks are indeed open to the participation of organisations from third countries, in view of fostering strategic international partnerships for the training and exchange of researchers.</p><p>These doctoral programmes will respond to well-identified needs in various R&amp;I areas, expose the researchers to the academic and non-academic sectors, and offer training in research-related, as well as transferable skills and competences relevant for innovation and long-term employability (e.g. entrepreneurship, commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication). Proposals for doctoral networks can reflect existing or planned research partnerships among the participating organisations.</p><p>The selection procedure for doctoral candidates must be open, transparent and merit-based, in line with the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers. The vacancy notice (to be widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS<sup>[1]</sup> website) must mention if the published rates include all employer and employee's taxes and contributions. If possible, the gross salary (net salary + employee’s taxes and contributions) should be published.</p><p>MSCA Doctoral Networks are encouraged to lead to Industrial or Joint Doctorates.</p><p><em>Industrial Doctorates</em></p><p>Through Industrial Doctorates, doctoral candidates will step outside academia and develop skills in industry and business by being jointly supervised by academic and non-academic organisations, both of which can be established in the same EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.</p><p><em>Joint Doctorates</em></p><p>Joint Doctorates represent a highly integrated type of international, inter-sectoral and multi/interdisciplinary collaboration in doctoral training. They lead to the delivery of joint, double or multiple doctoral degrees<sup>[2]</sup> recognised in at least one EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.</p><p><em>Supervisory Board</em></p><p>Each MSCA Doctoral Network should have a clearly identified supervisory board co-ordinating network-wide training, research and in particular supervision activities in line with the Guidelines for MSCA supervision, while establishing continuous communication and exchange of best practice among the participating organisations to maximise the benefits of the partnership.</p><p><em>Training activities</em></p><p>MSCA Doctoral Networks should exploit complementarities between participating organisations and foster sharing of knowledge and networking activities for example through the organisation of workshops and conferences. Proposed training activities should respond to well identified needs in various R&amp;I areas, with appropriate references to inter- and multidisciplinary fields and follow the EU Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training<sup>[3]</sup>. They should be primarily focused on developing new scientific knowledge through original research on personalised projects.</p><p>Inter-sectoral secondments of researchers to other participating organisations, including in third countries, are encouraged when relevant, feasible and beneficial for the researchers and in line with the project objectives. This will increase the employability of the researchers outside academia.</p><p>Doctoral Networks should develop substantial training modules, including digital ones, addressing key transferable skills and competences common to all fields and fostering the culture of Open Science, innovation and entrepreneurship as well as good scientific conduct such as research integrity. In particular, Doctoral Networks should adequately prepare doctoral candidates for increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to other research outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).</p><p><em>Supervision</em></p><p>Particular attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career guidance. Joint supervision of the researchers is mandatory for Industrial and Joint Doctorates.</p><p><em>Career Development Plan</em></p><p>A Career Development Plan must be established jointly by the supervisor and each recruited doctoral candidate. In case of joint supervision, such a plan should be established involving all supervisors. In addition to research objectives, this plan comprises the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The plan, established at the beginning of the recruitment, should be revised (and updated where needed) within 18 months.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/\">https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] Every time this Work Programme part refers to doctoral degrees, this means that the degrees have to be recognised as such by the relevant authorities of the country or countries concerned.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <a href=\"https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/policy_library/principles_for_innovative_doctoral_training.pdf\">principles_for_innovative_doctoral_training.pdf</a></p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Support the implementation of the Commission Communication on Advanced Materials for Industrial Leadership<sup>[1]</sup>.</li><li>Prolong lifespan and performance of components and products across sectors using IAMs-based coatings, functionalised surfaces and/or sealings to withstand specific or challenging requirements and/or harsh environments;</li><li>Lower maintenance needs and overall reduced Cost of Ownership for essential, structural or functional components and products;</li><li>Lower environmental impact through improved resource efficiency, reduced energy consumption, increased recyclability at end of life and/or substitution of hazardous substances.</li><li>Proof of concept of the ‘safe and sustainable by design’ (SSbD) framework during the development phase of the new IAMs;</li><li>Promote industrial uptake of IAMs by facilitating scalability and/or integration into leaner industrial production processes;</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>One of the main factors limiting the lifespan of products (and their components) is their prolonged exposure to environmental elements. The combination of different stressors and changing conditions (operational, daily, seasonal) results in accelerated aging and premature or unanticipated failures. To prevent the resulting adverse effects, protective coatings and sealings are key to provide additional protection without requiring the reassessment of the physical design of the product/component, nor the inherent properties of the parts to be coated/sealed.</p><p>Moreover, performance evaluation of coated samples to select coating solutions which meet the demands of industrial end users constitute another bottleneck in the fast development of IAM-based coatings. In addition, recyclability is often hampered by the sealants and coatings used. The new IAMs-based coatings, functionalised surfaces and sealings should allow to decompose products and structures into recyclable or reusable parts.</p><p>Proposals should develop new and/or improved IAMs-based coatings, functionalised surfaces and/or sealings that improve recyclability, circularity and safety of developed materials and products, reduce (raw) materials consumption, costs of production, manufacturing and disassembly by:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Combining multiple functionalities, e.g. fast curing and drying, self-curing, mechanical and durable robustness, protection from environmental agents (sun, rain, snow, humidity, corrosion, erosion, temperature, …), or a combination of beneficial thermal, acoustic, magnetic, electrical and tribological properties;</li><li>Satisfy multiple requirements across different application areas such as electronics; (renewable) energy production and storage; automotive; maritime; aviation and rail infrastructures; construction, including HVAC<sup>[2]</sup> components;</li> </ul><p>Multidisciplinary research activities should address at least two of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop strategies to accelerate the time-consuming performance evaluation step to greatly reduce the times to prototyping and then to market.</li><li>Develop functionalised surfaces (directly functionalised or via coatings), which can substantially improve the integrity, efficiency and overall performance of products and can cope with sometimes extreme surface areas (small/large) and complex and/or high aspect ratio geometries requiring advanced processing and tooling;</li><li>Design and develop new sealants and coatings that can be applied by automated processes (higher speed and precision by digitalization), cured at room temperature (no extra heating or air conditioning of large paint shops or hangars required) and with curing times reduced by at least 90% compared to the state-of-the-art (in terms of increased productivity and/or decreased energy consumption);</li><li>Master batch synthesis of IAMs with cutting-edge properties that allow production and processing of robust, fast and/or self-curing sealants and coatings to be applied in the manufacturing and final assembly lines in industries, and transferable between sectors;</li><li>Produce and share new knowledge on underlying multi-scale and multi-physics phenomena to better understand materials behaviour during their lifetime, develop and validate methodologies and suitable models to predict material degradation and assess release rates from coatings and sealants used in harsh environments;</li> </ul><p>In addition, all proposals should</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Use new digital technologies including data driven approaches to push the frontiers of designing and producing IAMs with new functionalities/performance, improve materials scalability and related processes and use analytical technologies and infrastructures to characterise the efficiency, quality and effectiveness of developed sealants, coatings or surfaces;</li><li>Contribute to the availability of FAIR<sup>[3]</sup> data and methods for safety and sustainability assessment of IAMs and for decision-making processes (at the design, engineering and end-of-life stage of IAMs and products);</li><li>Explore possibilities to transfer and use developed IAMs or technologies in other sectors; </li><li>Assess safety, sustainability and circularity of all components during the entire innovation cycle as well as how to decompose and sort for enhanced recyclability of all components at the end of life, in line with the safe and sustainable by design (SSbD) framework.</li> </ul><p>Proposals need to address both the IAM development and all the supporting technologies (digital and physical) needed (not existing yet) to cover the entire value chain (material development, validation, production, processing, use and end of life). Any existing technologies that do not require development or adaptation should be mentioned in the proposal.</p><p>Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.</p><p>Research should build on existing standards or contribute to standardisation of technologies for IAM-based sealings and coatings. Interoperability for data sharing should be addressed, in accordance with the FAIR<sup>[3]</sup> data principles. Projects should build on, or seek collaboration with, existing projects in EU Member States and Associated Countries and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms. Where relevant, projects are encouraged to take advantage of and connecting to European research infrastructures and services in the area of analytical research infrastructures.</p><p>International cooperation is encouraged, especially with Japan.</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership Innovative Advanced Materials for EU (IAM4EU). Proposals funded under this topic are part of the partnership portfolio and are expected to develop synergies with the related stakeholder community and contribute actively to the objectives of the partnership. The different stakeholder communities in IAM4EU are encouraged to coordinate amongst and across each other and foresee adequate resources for this as well as for the overall coordination with IAM4EU in the proposals.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>COM(2024) 98 final</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup>Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable data</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup>Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable data</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination “Developing and using new tools, technologies and digital solutions for a healthy society”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results directed towards and contributing to several of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Biomedical scientists dispose of tools that allow them to engineer cells with specific therapeutic features.</li><li>Improved methods and assays are available for biopharmaceutical developers.</li><li>Clinicians will get access to innovative therapeutic approaches enabling them to treat conditions, where there are currently no or only insufficient therapeutic strategies.</li><li>Cell engineering will be enriched and pave the way for novel personalised therapy options.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Therapies based on cells, stem cells or somatic cells, have been shown to be highly effective as therapeutics for a variety of health conditions. However, bottlenecks remain which currently hamper their safe and efficient application on a large scale. Genome- and epigenome editing have great potential to overcome some of these bottlenecks and to lead to the next-generation of cell-based therapies. Advancing the frontier of cell-based therapy with these tools and further translation of such research into clinically viable solutions may open up a new era of innovative therapies.</p><p>This topic aims at the design of engineered cells to address the current limitations of cellular therapies, such as delivery efficiency, patient safety, in vivo persistence, desired therapeutic effect, immune tolerance and manufacturing workflows. The chosen approach should enable to control the characteristics, fate and function of the engineered cells from gene level onwards and thus lead to customised cells with improved therapeutic features.</p><p>The use of genetic engineering and in particular gene editing tools should be a key element in the design of the engineered cells. The therapeutic action should be based on the endogenous capabilities of the cells; the exogenous loading of cells with drugs (using the cells as drug carrier) is not in scope.</p><p>The engineered cells should be derived from human cells. Either stem cells or somatic cells may be used, but of allogeneic origin, thereby opening up the development of “off-the-shelf” cell therapeutics.</p><p>Applicants should explicitly state in their proposal which of the following therapeutic areas is targeted and the proposed work should address only this specific therapeutic area:</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\" level=\"0\">  <li>Cancer and oncology</li><li>Nervous and sensory system</li><li>Cardiovascular and circulatory system</li><li>Endocrinology and metabolic system</li><li>Musculoskeletal system</li><li>Digestive system</li><li>Infectious diseases</li><li>Respiratory system</li><li>Dermatology</li><li>Immune system and auto-immune diseases</li><li>Other</li> </ol><p>The activities should comprise all the following elements:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Engineering of synthetic genetic circuits acting as switches to modulate the desired function(s) and their integration in the chosen cells, with the help of new genomic techniques. Next to new genomic techniques like genome and epigenome editing, also synthetic biology introducing transgenes or artificial genes may be used to endow the engineered cells with improved therapeutic properties and achieve the desired cell phenotype. The applicants should use gene control systems, including transcriptional, translational and/or post-translational control, or other approaches which install on-off switches and control systems, like e.g. a “sense-and-respond” mechanism in the engineered cells, sometimes also referred to as “theranostic cells”.</li><li>For the efficient construction and acceleration of the design-build-test cycles of the engineered cells containing the programmed functionalities state of the art tools including digital ones (e.g. Computer-Aided Design - CAD - and similar tools) should be used.</li><li>Suitable <em>in-vitro</em> and <em>ex-vivo</em> systems should be used for testing and demonstration of function and performance of the engineered cells. Their added value, safety and efficacy should be ensured in appropriate pre-clinical models for one specific therapeutic area. Any disease, dysfunction or health impairment may be selected as therapeutic area.</li><li>Applicants should show that the engineered cells are safe and exert the desired therapeutic effect <em>in-vivo</em>. Engagement and interaction with regulatory authorities during the project is essential for qualification of the developed cell-based therapy and in view of the conduct of clinical studies. The demonstration of the feasibility of the proposed cell-based therapy in first in-human studies would be an asset.</li> </ul><p>Sex differences should be taken into consideration, both with regard to the parent cells and for the targeted therapeutic application. Collaboration with relevant European research infrastructures and findings from EU-supported research projects should be considered. Participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is strongly encouraged.</p><p>Proposals should consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) as a potential interface between research activities and pre-normative regulatory science and in relation to the potential validation of test methods fit for regulatory purpose. In that respect, the JRC will consider collaborating with any successful proposal and this collaboration, when relevant, should be established after the proposal’s approval.</p><p>Applicants should provide details of their clinical studies<sup>[1]</sup> in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system. As proposals under this topic are expected to include clinical studies, the use of the template is strongly encouraged.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] Please note that the definition of clinical studies (see introduction to this work programme part) is broad and it is recommended that you review it thoroughly before submitting your application.</p>"

Extending a products’ life (use phase) is an important pillar of a solid sustainable and circular strategy because it reduces materials demands. In addition, new materials fit for the circular economy should be easily dismantlable into reusable or recyclable components. The actual condition and functional performance of products, components and materials should be monitored and assessed and smart maintenance and repair functions implemented, ideally at the level of individual products or components. Autonomous repair systems often use sensors to detect changes in the material's condition through physical principles or mechanical deformation. The smart (AI) exploitation of collected data enables real-time monitoring of the material's condition. The surfaces created in the building process are ideal for smart solutions incorporating ubiquitous electronic systems.</p><p>Proposals should develop new and/or improved IAMs that increase recyclability, circularity and safety of construction materials reducing (raw) materials consumption by:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased durability and reliability and reduced maintenance requirements (e.g. self-cleaning and/or self-healing properties, self-protection, increased stress resistance and innovative protection treatments such as corrosion and/or erosion resistance, increased fatigue resistance);</li><li>Support smart material functionalities for continuous monitoring and in-service inspections, e.g. through integrated sensors, with multifunctional features (such as asset management tracking, self-powering and/or self-sensing for several parameters).</li> </ul><p>Multidisciplinary research activities should address at least two of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop strategies to accelerate the time-consuming performance evaluation step to greatly reduce the times to prototyping and then to market.</li><li>Enhance sensor capabilities for tailored solutions through IAMs with extended physical sensor functionalities for mechanical-technological traits;</li><li>Develop self-repairing and -healing materials for complex and resource-intensive structures, receptive to digital stimuli to retroactively influence material properties and integrating autonomous repair mechanisms to enhance their reliability (such as in composites, ceramics, coatings, technical textiles etc), extend their lifespan and enabling easy recycling;</li><li>Develop (AI based) models like digital twins to utilize high-dimensional new sensor data and generate multimodal stimuli and functionalities for customised maintenance and repair plans, extending product lifetime economically and environmentally;</li><li>Produce and share new knowledge on underlying multi-scale and multi-physics phenomena to better understand materials behaviour during their lifetime, develop and validate methodologies and suitable models to predict materials degradation (mechanical and/or environmental) and to assess the longevity of materials, components and products through accelerated testing and functional performance verification;</li><li>Develop IAMs fit for modular off-site processing or 3D printing onsite;</li> </ul><p>In addition, all proposals should</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Use new digital technologies including data driven approaches to push the frontiers of designing and producing IAMs with new functionalities/performance, improve materials scalability and related processes and use analytical technologies and infrastructures to characterise the efficiency, quality and effectiveness of developed IAMs;</li><li>Contribute to the availability of FAIR<sup>[2]</sup> data and methods for safety and sustainability assessment of IAMs and for decision-making processes (at the design, engineering and end-of-life stage of IAMs and products);</li><li>Explore possibilities to transfer and use developed IAMs or technologies in other sectors;</li><li>Assess safety, sustainability and circularity of all components during the entire innovation cycle as well as how to decompose and sort for enhanced recyclability of all components at the end of life, in line with the safe and sustainable by design (SSbD) framework.</li> </ul><p>Proposals need to address both the IAM development and all the supporting technologies (digital and physical) needed (not existing yet) to cover the entire value chain (material development, validation, production, processing, use and end of life). Any existing technologies that do not require development or adaptation should be mentioned in the proposal.</p><p>Proposals should involve appropriate expertise in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), particularly regarding the acceptance of innovative construction materials for housing for maximized user experience and comfort. This may involve a perception analysis of these materials, resulting functionalities and the development of optimization strategies.</p><p>Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.</p><p>Research should build on existing standards or contribute to standardisation of technologies encompassing sensing, self-repairing or self-healing materials. Interoperability for data sharing should be addressed, in accordance with the FAIR data principles. Projects should build on, or seek collaboration with, existing projects in EU Member States and Associated Countries and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms. Where relevant, projects are encouraged to take advantage of and connecting to European analytical research infrastructures and services.</p><p>Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), whose contribution could consist of providing added value on new solutions for advanced materials in construction, including the ability to dismount and reuse, multifunctionality, smart maintenance and enhanced circularity and safety.</p><p>International cooperation is encouraged, especially with Japan.</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership Innovative Advanced Materials for the EU (IAM4EU). Proposals funded under this topic are part of the partnership portfolio and are expected to develop synergies with the related stakeholder community and contribute actively to the objectives of the partnership. The different stakeholder communities in IAM4EU are encouraged to coordinate amongst and across each other and foresee adequate resources for this as well as for the overall coordination with IAM4EU in the proposals.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>COM(2024) 98 final</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable data</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The strategic objective of this topic is to develop capabilities to ‘Act in Space’ through demonstrating in space a pilot mission by 2030 related to ISOS. The envisaged ISOS pilot mission shall provide the necessary seed components for a future service infrastructure, available to the European in-space ecosystem (including the EU assets), driving the generation of a new in-space economy, providing enhanced in-orbit technology demonstration and maximising EU technology non-dependence.</p><p>This pilot mission will largely contribute to ensure EU’s freedom of action in space, increase the resilience and protection of EU assets in space and foster the development of the new in-space economy. A pioneering and a novel mission concept which is unique compared to other initiatives among all space-faring nations is envisaged. The mission will build on previous R&amp;I with an operational mission concept, focusing on application and service demonstration, with a concrete view to commercial and governmental usage. The detailed mission concept will be derived in close coordination with EU Member States and EEA countries through a dedicated ISOS Pilot Mission Advisory Group (PMAG)<sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p>This topic addresses the finalisation of the detailed design of the <strong>servicing component of the ISOS pilot mission</strong>, that should feature robotic capabilities. The servicing component will be based on previous and ongoing R&amp;I developments and could provide services such as inspection, upgrade, repair, life extension including refuelling, delivery and exchange of payload, reconfiguration, relocation, capture and removal of assets in space.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>A sustainable, highly automated and digitalised, flexible and economically viable space infrastructure, building on technologies and concepts for a circular economy in space, e.g. plug-and-play spacecraft functionality introducing recycling/re-use of spacecraft modules/functionalities;</li><li>ISOS Pilot mission preparation up to detailed mission and system design for the servicing component and maturation of enabling technologies and innovative system and operational concepts;</li><li>Elaboration of interfaces between the different components of the mission, together with the other mission components (i.e. HOST, logistics and satAPPs) and the ISOS Pilot Mission Coordination and Support Action (CSA)<sup>[2]</sup>;</li><li>Contribution to the ISOS Pilot Mission Objectives provided in the technical annex<sup>163</sup>;</li><li>Elaboration of clear use cases and relevant business models focussing on governmental and/or commercial needs;</li><li>Ensuring the availability of results to the next mission phases. </li> </ul><p>This topic will contribute to, in the medium to long term, developing, deploying global space-based services and contribute to fostering the European space sector competitiveness, as stated in the expected impact of this destination.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>To tackle the above expected outcomes, the following R&amp;I actions should be addressed, taking into account the provided technical annex<sup>[3]</sup>:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>R&amp;I to complete detailed mission and system design<sup>[4]</sup> (including relevant key technology maturation) for the servicing component as part of the ISOS pilot mission. More specifically, projects should finalise the detailed design for this component building on current or previous developments, demonstrating the achievement of the required TRL for all relevant technologies;</li><li>Contribution to the overall ISOS pilot mission detail design in close cooperation with the other mission components (including other servicing components), the ISOS Pilot Mission Coordination and Support Action and the ISOS Pilot Mission Advisory Group;</li><li>R&amp;I on related service capabilities and applications including operational concepts for servicing individual or fleets of satellites based on the functionality of the pilot mission system design. More specifically, possible use case for servicing a real EU asset is expected to be developed up to delivery of a concept of operations (CONOPS). </li> </ul><p>Projects are expected to ensure full compliance to the ISOS detailed pilot mission concept including interoperability with the other mission components, in case a possibility for a standalone IOD for the proposed servicing component materialises earlier than the ISOS pilot mission.</p><p>Proposals are expected to promote cooperation between different actors (industry, SMEs and research institutions) and consider opportunities to quickly turn technological innovation into commercial use in space via e.g., on-ground or in-orbit demonstration.</p><p>Proposals should clearly present a concrete plan to ensure that required technologies reach the necessary TRL at the end of the project. Moreover, complementarities with previous and/or ongoing R&amp;I for the proposed servicing component should be clearly described. More specifically, proposals should explore relevant and promising solutions developed in Horizon Europe, Horizon 2020, or other EU-funded relevant activities, in particular, the topics: Future Space Ecosystem (HORIZON-CL4-2021-SPACE-01-12/ 2022-SPACE-01-11/ 2023-SPACE-01-12) and in relevant projects funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) and/or national programmes. Finally, proposals are also expected to consider the use of existing European technologies and/or building blocks, including at component level, contributing to European non-dependence and strengthen competitiveness. </p><p>Proposals are expected to consider and contribute to a balanced provision of Member States’ and eligible Associated Countries’ expertise and capabilities to the overall ISOS pilot mission, to support a successful introduction of the strategic capacity ‘Act in Space’ for the EU, its Member States and other partners.</p><p>This topic contributes to the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP<sup>[5]</sup>) and addresses Space technologies falling under the sectors of “digital technologies” and “deep tech innovation”<sup>[6]</sup>. This topic addresses objectives stated in the STEP Regulation, e.g., the development of critical technologies and safeguarding and strengthening their EU value chain. This topic will contribute to advancing digital capabilities in space and enhance the sustainability and agility of the EU's space assets.</p><p>In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.</p><p>The project(s) selected from this topic are expected to collaborate among themselves and with those selected under topics HORIZON-CL4-2025-02-SPACE-22, 23, 24 and ISOS Pilot Mission Coordination and Support Action, in order to ensure interoperability and the necessary and sufficient documentation and information sharing for the implementation of the Pilot Mission, to make economies of scale in sharing best practices, defining common processes for addressing the different challenges, ensuring efficient monitoring and review, organising dissemination and communication activities, etc. Such collaboration among all those projects will be formalised by a collaboration agreement.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>The ISOS Pilot Mission Advisory Group (PMAG) is composed of representatives of the Commission and the public authorities of interested Member States and EEA countries, under the chair of the Commission, with the objective to frame the ISOS Pilot Mission.

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The topic encompasses actions within the scope of the co-programmed European Partnership on Globally Competitive Space Systems (‘Space Partnership’) in the areas of satellite communication (SatCom), Earth Observation (EO) and New Commercial Space Transportation Solutions and is part of cohesive activities in the domain of digital developments under the grand heading of “digitalisation for commercial space solutions”.</p><p>Under the area of <em>Using Space on Earth</em> related to SatCom and EO, below this topic focusses on the Mid to High TRL level developments of key technologies required to strengthen competitiveness in these domains. Digitalisation is a major enabler for enhancing the value of an End-to-End EO and SatCom system. For example, processing applied to multi-sensor data can significantly enhance the resolution of the final data set, and digital optimisation of the data flow directly improves the End-to-End timeliness of an EO system (from request to delivery). Lastly, the enhancement of End-to-End data resilience and integrity calls for digital technologies on-board and, on the ground.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to one or several of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enable the European Space Industry to maintain a significant share of the global connectivity market by increasing the performance of space satellite networks, new type of control, space and ground segments being fully integrated into the terrestrial networks;</li><li>New commercial services and applications enabled by an increased digitalisation of space solutions;</li> </ul><p>Advanced Earth observation payloads, technologies and processing means, for multiple spectrum and frequency bands capabilities (on ground and in space), as well as optimisation of data downlink for all types of observation missions. This will contribute to developing, deploying global, more flexible and reactive space-based services applications, to contribute to fostering the EU's space sector competitiveness, as stated in the expected impact of this destination.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The areas of R&amp;I, which needs to be addressed to tackle the above-mentioned expected outcomes are:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>R&amp;I on End-to-End SatCom Mission capabilities (e.g., satellite network interconnectivity, seamless integration into the terrestrial networks, taking into account and contributing to ongoing standardisation efforts, increased reactivity), strengthening efficient connectivity using various technologies (e.g. optical communication, Inter Satellite Links, reconfigurable payloads) and ensure compatibility and interoperability with 5G &amp; 6G networks, and satellites as network nodes in a distributed system (e.g., ubiquitous use of orbital resources, distributed computing, embracing both ground and space), flexible and modular testbed for complex satcom typologies to assess performances, compatibility of the different elements and operations concepts, data fusion;</li><li>R&amp;I on on-board processing to optimize EO missions’ performance or timeliness (e.g., standardized software framework to host embedded edge-computing applications -AI, Machine Learning, in combination with onboard image processing for multiple spectrum and frequency bands capabilities-, data/signal image processing, enhanced downlink and uplink capabilities), EO ground segment interfaces and data flow standardisation and adoption (e.g., development of use cases demonstrating the associated digital building-blocks, at least in ground relevant environment), smart multi-source EO intelligence information fusion (e.g., innovative intelligence information extraction and fusion), EO-related equipment and instruments digitalisation (e.g., miniaturization of equipment, enhancement of the European optical digital detectors supply);</li><li>R&amp;I on synergetic technologies, building blocks and processes with applicability across both EO and SatCom systems and missions, such as maturation of technologies and products improving system security and threats identification, resources usage optimization, tools to support the measure of key environmentally driven criteria through increased resource sharing, and maturation of high-performance processing payload H/W and payload data flexible downlink to support space network capabilities together with software functions to demonstrate mission flexibility.</li> </ul><p>Developments should aim at on-ground relevant environment or in-orbit demonstration focusing on software and digital tools (e.g. algorithms, functions), supporting open-HW alternatives (e.g. processors, electronics) such as RISC-V or similar from design to pre-operation phases.</p><p>Proposals may contribute to one or more of the above R&amp;I areas, however the main area addressed should be clearly and unambiguously identified. To ensure a balanced portfolio covering the three areas described above, grants will be awarded to applications not only in order of ranking but at least also to one proposal that is the highest ranked within each area, provided that the applications attain all thresholds. For the purposes of the ranking the main area declared by the proposal will be considered.</p><p>Proposals are expected to promote cooperation between different actors (industry, SMEs and research institutions) and consider opportunities to quickly turn technological innovation into commercial use in space via e.g., on-ground relevant environment or in orbit demonstration.</p><p>Proposals under this topic should explore synergies and be complementary to already funded actions in the context of technology development at component level, while still enabling new entrants and new approaches. In particular the topics: Critical Space Technologies for European non-dependence (HE H2020 SPACE-10-TEC-2018-2020, COMPET-1-2014-2015-2016-2017, HORIZON-CL4-2021-SPACE-01-81/ 2023-SPACE-01-72/ 2024-SPACE-01-73), satellite communication technologies and high speed data chain (H2020 COMPET-2-2016, COMPET-3-2017, SPACE-15-TEC-2018, SPACE-29-TEC-2020, HORIZON-CL4-2021-SPACE-01-11), Earth Observation end-to-end technologies (HORIZON-CL4-2022-SPACE-01-13, HORIZON-CL4-2023-SPACE-01-11). It is expected that projects make use of existing European technologies and/or building blocks, including at component level, contributing to European non-dependence and strengthen competitiveness, and this should be clearly presented in the proposal. Furthermore, proposed activities should be complementary to H2020 and Horizon Europe funded projects, national activities and activities funded by the European Space Agency (ESA).</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Globally Competitive Space Systems’ (GCSS). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Globally Competitive Space Systems’ (GCSS) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. </p><p>This topic contributes to the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) and addresses Space technologies falling under the sectors of “digital technologies” and “deep tech innovation”. This topic addresses objectives stated in the STEP Regulation, e.g., the development of critical technologies and safeguarding and strengthening their EU value chain. This topic will help reduce strategic dependencies from outside of the EU for components and equipment for the EU Space Programme, as well as for other European space applications.</p><p>In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination “Living and working in a health-promoting environment”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed, tailored and contributing to most of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Environmental and health policies reducing exposure to micro- and nanoplastics and preventing their potential health impacts are supported with up-to-date scientific evidence, standards, tools and methodologies;</li><li>Public authorities and the scientific community have access to FAIR<sup>[1]</sup> data on realistic human exposures to micro- and nanoplastics and their potential impacts on human health based on real-world scenarios across living and working environments;</li><li>Citizens are informed about the impacts of exposure to micro- and nanoplastics on health and adopt behaviours protecting health and reducing human impacts on the environment;</li><li>Industry is supported in the assessment of products’ safety and sustainability;</li><li>Existing major knowledge gaps in the understanding of the health impacts of exposure to micro- and nanoplastics are filled and mitigation measures based on robust evidence are promoted;</li><li>Public authorities and regulators are supported with evidence-based guidance to design health policies.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Plastics are an important material in our economy that are everywhere in our daily lives but can present negative environmental and health impacts. A significant amount of plastic ends up in the environment, degrading into micro- or nano-sized plastic particles that are defined as micro- or nanoplastics (MNPs). MNPs can be detected in both marine and terrestrial ecosystems worldwide in food, water, air and consumer products. These MNPs have been documented to accumulate in the human body into cells and tissues (e.g. liver, kidney, gastrointestinal track, placenta, testicles) and cause associated adverse biological effects (e.g. inflammatory response, geno-, cyto-, neuro- and nephron-, respiratory and reproductive toxicity). Exposure routes for MNPs into the human body can be through inhalation, ingestion and dermal contact and translocation of nanoplastics and small microplastics through tissues and organs can occur. Furthermore, it has been documented that MNPs can cause additional harm by releasing specific chemical additives with potentially negative health impacts. However, because microplastics are an emerging contaminant and research on the causality between exposure to MNPs and health impacts is still at a relatively early stage, the evidence on the health risks of exposure to MNPs is scattered and numerous knowledge gaps still persist.</p><p>Research activities under this topic should strengthen the evidence on the impacts of micro- and nanoplastics exposure on human health, considering living and working environments and different exposure routes (inhalation, ingestion and dermal exposure). Proposals should focus on realistic concentrations of tested particles and exposures to a variety of sizes, shapes and chemical compositions of MNPs materials and advance in the comparability between studies. Moreover, research activities should take into account recent policy developments, support relevant policy gaps and needs and support the work on standardisation of analytical methods.</p><p>More specifically, research actions under this topic should include several of the following activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increase comparability and reproducibility between studies by means of a better optimisation, validation and standardisation of the analytical methods, protocols and methodologies to collect MNPs in the environment and detect and quantify the exposure in the human body and in the environment;</li><li>Study the causal mechanisms of action and pathways involved on molecular, cellular and organism level effects from exposure to MNPs;</li><li>Improve the understanding of the drivers of toxicity and other adverse health effects of MNPs, using realistic environmental samples and considering varying sizes, shapes, concentrations and chemical compositions, and interaction with components in the environment;</li><li>Develop suitable and (environmentally) relevant reference materials that can be used to improve robustness and comparability across laboratories;</li><li>Develop better in-vivo, in-silico and in-vitro models, instruments and methods for risk and hazard assessment harmonised across various types of MNPs. These include long-term exposure and monitoring models, mimicking real-world scenarios and dosimetry and observational studies on humans and development of strategies to integrate experimental and in-silico data;</li><li>Strengthen the existing knowledge on human exposure to micro- and nanoplastics through the development of human biomonitoring studies and the use of specific biomarkers and endpoints;</li><li>Generate evidence on the long-term impacts of MNPs on human health, MNPs’ fate and systemic effects through well-designed and robust systematic studies;</li><li>Provide robust evidence on the exposures to MNPs at work: identify environments with highest concentrations and focus on improving approaches for assessment, prevention and mitigation of occupational exposures;</li><li>Increase the understanding of the environmental routes of exposure to MNPs, considering real-life exposure routes;</li><li>Propose mitigation measures to reduce population exposure to MNPs including collecting evidence on the health impacts of potential alternative materials developed to replace plastics;</li><li>Gain better insights on the interactions between MNPs (and their additives) with other pollutants and/or biological agents and the combined impacts of these interactions on human health (considering also the understanding of individual toxicity effects);</li><li>Gain better insights on the delivery mechanisms and study the elimination process of MNPs in the human body and the microbiome capacity to degrade (or accelerate degradation of) ingested MNPs;</li><li>Promote exchange of knowledge and experiences across MS and policies and engage with regulators and public authorities to ensure suitability and further uptake of relevant results.</li> </ul><p>Gender and sex related differences should be addressed, where appropriate.</p><p>Applicants are encouraged to consider the use of experimental methods not using live animals, where relevant and allowing to obtain data of comparable validity.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Proposals should adhere to the FAIR<sup>[1]</sup> data principles and adopt wherever relevant, data standards and data sharing/access good practices.</p><p>Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) with respect to the value it could bring in providing an effective interface between research activities and regulatory aspects and/or in translating research results into harmonised test methods and strategies fit for regulatory purpose. In that respect, the JRC will consider collaborating with any successful proposal and this collaboration, when relevant, should be established after the proposal’s approval.</p><p>Proposals should also ensure that chemical monitoring including human biomonitoring data are shared in the Information Platform for Chemical Monitoring (IPCHEM)<sup>[3]</sup> through involvement with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), and/or in the future Common Data Platform for Chemicals, through involvement with the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA)<sup>[4]</sup> or other relevant decentralised EU agency (such as the European Environment Agency - EEA<sup>[5]</sup>) responsible for the specific domain. In that respect, the JRC, ECHA or other relevant decentralised EU agency(ies) should collaborate with any successful proposal and this collaboration, when relevant, should be established after the proposal’s approval.</p><p>In order to maximise synergies and increase the impact of the projects, all proposals selected for funding from this topic will form a cluster and be required to participate in common networking and joint activities. Without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities, proposals should allocate a sufficient budget for the attendance of regular joint meetings and to cover the costs of any other potential common networking and joint activities. Guidance on the potential activities to be developed can be obtained by consulting the clusters of projects ongoing under the Environment, climate and health portfolio<sup>[6]</sup>.</p><p>Applicants invited to the second stage should provide details of their clinical studies<sup>[7]</sup> in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system. As proposals under this topic are expected to include clinical studies, the use of the template is strongly encouraged.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] See definition of FAIR data in the introduction to this work programme part.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] See definition of FAIR data in the introduction to this work programme part.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <a href=\"https://ipchem.jrc.ec.europa.eu\">https://ipchem.jrc.ec.europa.eu</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <a href=\"https://echa.europa.eu\">https://echa.europa.eu</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <a href=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu\">https://www.eea.europa.eu</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/health/environment-and-health_en\">https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/health/environment-and-health_en</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] Please note that the definition of clinical studies (see introduction to this work programme part) is broad and it is recommended that you review it thoroughly before submitting your application.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The topic encompasses actions within the scope of the co-programmed European Partnership on Globally Competitive Space Systems (‘Space Partnership’) in the areas of satellite communication (SatCom), Earth Observation (EO) and New Commercial Space Transportation Solutions and is part of cohesive activities in the domain of digital developments under the grand heading of “digitalisation for commercial space solutions”.</p><p>Under the area of <em>Using Space on Earth</em> related to SatCom and EO, below this topic focus on the fast increment of the Low to Mid TRL level building blocks for key technologies required to strengthen competitiveness in these domains. Digitalisation is a major enabler for enhancing the value of an End-to-End EO and SatCom system. For example, processing applied to multi-sensor data can significantly enhance the resolution of the final data set, and digital optimisation of the data flow directly improves the End-to-End timeliness of an EO system (from request to delivery). Lastly, the enhancement of End-to-End data resilience and integrity calls for digital technologies on-board and, on the ground.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to one or several of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enable the European Space Industry to maintain a significant share of the global connectivity market by increasing the performance of space satellite networks, new type of control, space and ground segments being fully integrated into the terrestrial networks;</li><li>New commercial services and applications enabled by increased digitalisation of space solutions;</li><li>Advanced Earth observation payloads, technologies and processing means (on ground and/or in space), for all types of observation missions.</li> </ul><p>This will contribute to developing, deploying global, more flexible and reactive space-based services applications, to contribute to fostering the EU's space sector competitiveness, as stated in the expected impact of this destination.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The areas of R&amp;I, which needs to be addressed to tackle the above-mentioned expected outcomes are:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>R&amp;I on End-to-End SatCom Mission capabilities (e.g., satellite network interconnectivity, seamless integration into the terrestrial networks, taking into account and contributing to ongoing standardisation efforts, increased reactivity), strengthening efficient connectivity using various technologies (e.g. optical communication, Inter Satellite Links, reconfigurable payloads) and ensure compatibility and interoperability with 5G &amp; 6G, and satellites as network nodes in a distributed system (e.g., ubiquitous use of orbital resources, distributed computing, embracing both ground and space), flexible and modular testbed prototype with representative building blocks for complex SatCom typologies, improve SatCom performances using innovative technologies (data fusion, user terminal development, new generation antennas, SDR payloads, exploitation of higher bands, etc).</li><li>R&amp;I on breakthrough harmonization enabling interoperability among multiple EO missions, breakthrough digitalized technology steps, such as AI algorithms, high performance cloud-based architectures, active and adaptive optics and/or higher power electronics (focal plane and RF back-ends and front-ends), mature (on-board and/or ground) digital techniques and technologies to support novel operational approaches, mature miniaturised instruments design - including their digitalized on-board processing electronics- fit for affordable EO constellations to address emerging markets;</li><li>R&amp;I on lower maturity building blocks and processes common to EO and SatCom systems, such as technologies and products improving system security and threats identification, resources usage optimization, tools to support the measure of key environmentally driven criteria through increased resource sharing, and maturation of high-performance processing payload H/W to support space network capabilities together with software functions to support reconfigurability, inter alia.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should address at least one of the areas outlined above.</p><p>Proposals are expected to promote cooperation between different actors (industry, SMEs and research institutions) and consider opportunities to quickly turn technological innovation into commercial use in space.</p><p>Proposals under this topic should explore synergies and be complementary to already funded actions in the context of technology development at component level, while still enabling new entrants and new approaches. In particular the topics: Critical Space Technologies for European non-dependence (HE H2020 SPACE-10-TEC-2018-2020, COMPET-1-2014-2015-2016-2017, HORIZON-CL4-2021-SPACE-01-81/ 2023-SPACE-01-72/ 2024-SPACE-01-73), satellite communication technologies (H2020 COMPET-2-2016, COMPET-3-2017, SPACE-15-TEC-2018, SPACE-29-TEC-2020, HORIZON-CL4-2021-SPACE-01-11), Earth Observation end-to-end technologies (HORIZON-CL4-2022-SPACE-01-13, HORIZON-CL4-2023-SPACE-01-11). It is expected that projects make use of existing European technologies and/or building blocks, including at component level, contributing to European non-dependence and strengthen competitiveness, and this should be clearly presented in the proposal. Furthermore, proposed activities should be complementary to H2020 and Horizon Europe funded projects, national activities and activities funded by the European Space Agency (ESA).</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Globally Competitive Space Systems’ (GCSS). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Globally Competitive Space Systems’ (GCSS) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. </p><p>In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination “Maintaining an innovative, sustainable, and competitive EU health industry”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to most of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Academic and industrial developers advance processes that support the timely and robust development of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs);</li><li>Manufacturers integrate improved technologies/processes (including Artificial Intelligence solutions), analytic tools, methods including non-clinical methods and assays for more flexible manufacturing of ATMPs;</li><li>Healthcare providers, researchers and patients get faster access to ATMPs with demonstrated health benefits for unmet medical needs;</li><li>Companies in the EU and Associated countries get a better market position in the field of ATMP manufacturing and improve their knowledge on how to advance process improvements;</li><li>The EU and Associated countries lay the foundations for academic centres of excellence<sup>[1]</sup> in ATMPs.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>New pioneering treatments called Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs)<sup>[2]</sup>, including cell and gene therapies, are at the cutting edge of medicines discovery. Owing to their precise nature, ATMPs embody personalised medicine and reflect a shift in medicine towards potentially one-time curative therapies instead of chronic therapies that mainly cure the symptoms but not the underlying cause of diseases.</p><p>ATMPs have undergone important technological advancements that are improving their efficacy, precision, scalability, and safety. Additionally, the disease focus of ATMPs is likely to shift further from rare diseases to more common conditions with larger patient populations. However, the development and manufacturing of ATMPs still faces important challenges, such as long development times, expensive manufacturing processes and a fragmented and dispersed biomanufacturing landscape.</p><p>The topic focuses on addressing the challenges of ATMP manufacturing, the need for highly specialised equipment and facilities, including in-process quality control and validation tests, scaling up and batch-to-batch reproducibility, whilst maintaining the efficacy of an ATMP product during the manufacturing process and/or the transition from centralised to decentralised manufacturing.</p><p>This topic aims to optimise the ATMP production where the general manufacturing process for a given medicinal product has already been established but has not been sufficiently optimised for its scale-up. Collaboration is crucial to refine the manufacturing of ATMPs, emphasising advancements in processes - including leveraging the potential of digital tools and advanced sensors -, fostering standardisation and enhancing quality controls for more efficient production and deployment of these innovative therapies, ideally covering the entire manufacturing lifecycle.</p><p>The proposals should address all the following activities for only one chosen category of ATMP as defined by Regulation 1394/2007 per proposal:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Design an improved manufacturing process for ATMPs by:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Exploring the potential of platform technologies in manufacturing, quality control, non-clinical or clinical testing;</li><li>Integrating either computational modelling, automation, robotics or digital/Artificial Intelligence solutions with meaningful and measurable impact;</li>   </ul> </li><li>Verify the improved performance of the developed process, in comparison to established ones.</li><li>Demonstrate a reduction in the timeframe and costs of manufacturing while maintaining product quality and standardisation.</li><li>Demonstrate the translatability, scalability, and robustness of the process suitable for the flexible manufacturing (centralised or decentralised) and deployment of ATMPs by important stakeholders in a patient-centric manner, including the medical community and hospitals.</li><li>Assess the process and methods developed for their regulatory validity and utility (for example standardised assays including for potency), taking into consideration the potential regulatory impact of the results and, as relevant, develop a regulatory strategy for generating appropriate evidence as well as engaging with regulators in a timely manner.</li><li>Promote green and sustainable industrial production and minimise environmental impact.</li> </ul><p>Participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is strongly encouraged and proposals should include a commitment for first deployment in the EU.</p><p>Where relevant, proposals are warmly invited to liaise with the Coordination and Support Action (CSA) project JOIN4ATMP<sup>[3]</sup>, in view of creating complementarities and potential synergies.</p><p>The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as a member of the consortium selected for funding. Proposals should consider the involvement of the European Commission's JRC regarding its experience in this field and with respect to the value it could bring in providing an effective interface between research activities and pre-normative science as well as strategies and frameworks that address regulatory requirements. In that respect, the JRC will consider collaborating with any successful proposal and this collaboration, when relevant, should be established after the proposal’s approval.</p><p>Applicants envisaging to include clinical studies<sup>[4]</sup> should provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] A centre of excellence refers to a team with a clear focus on a particular area of research; such a centre may bring together faculty members from different disciplines and provide shared facilities.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] ATMPs as classified by the European Medicines Agency (EMA): <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory-overview/advanced-therapy-medicinal-products-overview\">https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory-overview/advanced-therapy-medicinal-products-overview</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101137206/program/43108390/details\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101137206/program/43108390/details</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101137206\">https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101137206</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] Please note that the definition of clinical studies (see introduction to this work programme part) is broad and it is recommended that you review it thoroughly before submitting your application.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The strategic objective of this topic is to develop capabilities to ‘Act in Space’ through demonstrating in space a pilot mission by 2030 related to ISOS. The envisaged ISOS pilot mission shall provide the necessary seed components for a future service infrastructure, available to the European in-space ecosystem (including the EU assets), driving the generation of a new in-space economy, providing enhanced in-orbit technology demonstration and maximising EU technology non-dependence.</p><p>This pilot mission will largely contribute to ensure EU’s freedom of action in space, increase the resilience and protection of EU assets in space and foster the development of the new in-space economy. A pioneering and a novel mission concept, which is unique compared to other initiatives among all space-faring nations is envisaged. The mission will build on previous R&amp;I with an operational mission concept, focusing on application and service demonstration, with a concrete view to commercial and governmental usage. The detailed mission concept will be derived in close coordination with EU Member States and EEA countries through a dedicated ISOS Pilot Mission Advisory Group (PMAG)<sup>161</sup>.</p><p>This topic addresses the detailed design of the <strong>logistics component of the ISOS pilot mission</strong>. This component shall be able to transport cargo (i.e., satAPPs and propellant) taken from an upper stage to the HOST component.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>A sustainable, highly automated, flexible and economically viable space infrastructure, building on technologies and concepts for a circular economy in space, e.g. plug-and-play spacecraft functionality introducing recycling/re-use of spacecraft modules/functionalities;</li><li>ISOS Pilot mission preparation up to detailed mission and system design for the logistics component and maturation of enabling technologies and innovative system and operational concepts;</li><li>Elaboration of interfaces between the different components of the mission, together with the other mission components (i.e. servicing, HOST and satAPPs) and the ISOS Pilot Mission Coordination and Support Action (CSA)<sup>162</sup>;</li><li>Contribution to the ISOS Pilot Mission Objectives provided in the technical annex<sup>163</sup>;</li><li>Elaboration of clear use cases and relevant business models focussing on governmental and/or commercial needs;</li><li>Ensuring the availability of results to the next mission phases. </li> </ul><p>This topic will contribute to, in the medium to long term, developing, deploying global space-based services and contribute to fostering the European space sector competitiveness, as stated in the expected impact of this destination.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>To tackle the above expected outcomes, the following R&amp;I actions should be addressed, taking into account the provided technical annex<sup>163</sup>:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>R&amp;I to complete ISOS Pilot mission detailed mission and system design<sup>164</sup> (including relevant key technology maturation) for the logistics component, demonstrating the achievement of the required TRL for all relevant technologies;</li><li>R&amp;I on key enabling technologies relevant for design of a logistics component that can transport cargo (i.e., satAPPs and propellant) taken from an upper stage to the HOST component;</li><li>R&amp;I on solutions for docking and propellant management and transfer with the HOST. Building on existing European designs is encouraged;</li><li>Contribution to the overall ISOS pilot mission detail design in close cooperation with other mission components, the ISOS Pilot Mission Coordination and Support Action and the ISOS Pilot Mission Advisory Group. </li> </ul><p>Proposals are expected to promote cooperation between different actors (industry, SMEs and research institutions) and consider opportunities to quickly turn technological innovation into commercial use in space.</p><p>Proposals should clearly present a concrete plan to ensure that required technologies reach the necessary TRL at the end of the project. Moreover, complementarities with previous and/or ongoing R&amp;I for the proposed servicing component must be clearly described. More specifically, proposals should explore relevant and promising solutions developed in Horizon Europe, Horizon 2020, or other EU-funded relevant activities, in particular, the topics: Future Space Ecosystem (HORIZON-CL4-2021-SPACE-01-12/ 2022-SPACE-01-11/ 2023-SPACE-01-12) and in relevant projects funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) and/or national programmes. Finally, proposals are also expected to consider the use of existing European technologies and/or building blocks, including at component level, contributing to European non-dependence and strengthen competitiveness.</p><p>Proposals are expected to consider and contribute to a balanced provision of Member States’ and eligible Associated Countries’ expertise and capabilities to the overall ISOS pilot mission, to support a successful introduction of the strategic capacity ‘Act in Space’ for the EU and its Member States.</p><p>This topic contributes to the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP<sup>[1]</sup>) and addresses Space technologies falling under the sectors of “digital technologies” and “deep tech innovation”<sup>[2]</sup>. This topic addresses objectives stated in the STEP Regulation, e.g., the development of critical technologies and safeguarding and strengthening their EU value chain. This topic will contribute to advancing digital capabilities in space and enhance the sustainability and agility of the EU's space assets.</p><p>In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.</p><p>The project selected from this topic is expected to collaborate with those selected under topics HORIZON-CL4-2025-02-SPACE-21, 22, 24 and ISOS Pilot Mission Coordination and Support Action, in order to ensure interoperability and the necessary and sufficient documentation and information sharing for the implementation of the Pilot Mission, to make economies of scale in sharing best practices, defining common processes for addressing the different challenges, ensuring efficient monitoring and review, organising dissemination and communication activities, etc. Such collaboration among all those projects will be formalised by a collaboration agreement.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>OJ L, 2024/795, 29.2.2024, ELI: <a href=\"http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/795/oj\">http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/795/oj</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>C(2024) 3148 final</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to some of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Healthcare practitioners and providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)<sup>[1]</sup> and/or those in high-income countries (HICs) serving disadvantaged populations have access to information allowing to strengthen health systems for equitable high-quality care and health outcomes in the context of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).</li><li>Public health managers and authorities have access to improved insights and evidence on how to decrease the fragmentation of care for patients living with NCDs and ensure continuity of care across all stages of disease progression, including prevention, risk reduction, and timely diagnosis of NCDs. They use this knowledge to design policies to reduce health inequities and to promote equitable health outcomes.</li><li>Researchers, clinicians and authorities have an improved understanding how the proposed interventions for strengthening health systems for equitable high-quality care and health outcomes in the context of NCDs could be adopted in LMICs and/or disadvantaged populations of HICs setting, taking into account specific social, political, economic and cultural contexts.</li><li>Communities, local stakeholders and authorities are fully engaged in implementing and taking up interventions that strengthen health systems for equitable high-quality care and health outcomes in the context of NCDs and thus contribute to deliver better health, improve quality of life across the life course and extend healthy life expectancy.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The European Commission is a member of the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD)<sup>[2]</sup>. The GACD specifically addresses NCDs and supports implementation science to improve health outcomes. This topic is launched in concertation with the other GACD members (international funding agencies) and aligned with the 10<sup>th</sup> GACD call.</p><p>Health systems in many countries have not kept pace with the rapid emergence of NCDs that require costly long-term care and treatment. Resilient, fit for purpose health system should provide high-quality, safe, equitable, accessible healthcare, that reflects the needs of the population, and enables the integration of healthcare across the care continuum, encompassing prevention, screening, diagnosis and long-term management of NCDs<sup>[3]</sup>. While health systems across the world struggle with these challenges, this is a particular problem in LMICs that have relatively overburdened, poorly resourced and fragile health systems that struggle to cope with the burden of NCDs. Health inequalities (e.g. linked to geographical location, socioeconomic status, sex and/or gender, ethnicity, disability) are often accentuated by structural and/or systemic weaknesses such as lack of staff and appropriate medicines.</p><p>The increasing burden of NCDs on healthcare systems has spurred a greater interest in exploring strategies to tackle these conditions, including a move from a healthcare system focused on disease and hospital-based care, to a more holistic model, involving communities and primary care, and focused on maintaining health<sup>[4]</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>[5]</sup>. These include interventions addressing the integration of and access to care, screening, access to medicines and technologies, task shifting and digital health interventions. Implementing these strategies while retaining a focus on equity is challenging and health systems need to account for geographical disparities as well as reach communities that have traditionally suffered health inequalities. Equity in health requires that resources and processes are designed to promote equalisation of health outcomes for populations experiencing health disparities, to ensure similar health outcomes for all of society<sup>[6]</sup>.</p><p>Evidence for how to strengthen health systems to improve services and ensure equitable health outcomes is emerging, mostly from research in HICs. However, implementing equity-oriented interventions for transformation and/or strengthening of health systems remains challenging and largely unexplored in underserved populations, especially in LMICs. Providing evidence on implementation strategies that can enable effective adaptation and scaling of programmes will be critical to improving survival and quality of life as well as reducing disability, the burden of caretaking on (typically female) family members and costs of healthcare falling on households.</p><p>This implementation research topic is therefore focused on strategies to support health system transformation and/or strengthening using evidence-based interventions in the context of NCDs that can be adapted to and implemented in LMICs and/or disadvantaged populations experiencing health disparities in HICs to encourage equitable health outcomes.</p><p>The proposed implementation research should be focused on one or more evidence-based interventions (or complex interventions) focused on building equity-orientated health systems change to tackle the growing burden of chronic conditions, including NCDs. The choice of intervention(s) and provision of existing evidence of the intervention’s effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, sustainability, scalability and potential for long-term health and other impacts should be justified (and in what context this evidence has been generated). As the evidence underpinning strategies to transform and/or strengthen health systems in the context of NCDs is still emerging, particularly in LMICs, a limited period of testing the effectiveness of an intervention that the applicant’s team has adapted for local implementation is therefore usually appropriate.</p><p>Applicants should explore the implementation of proposed intervention(s) for a selected study population(s) taking into account the unique social, political, economic, and cultural context(s) in which the study will take place. Applicants should justify why any adaptation will not compromise the known effectiveness of the selected intervention(s).</p><p>Proposals should address all the following activities<sup>[7]</sup>:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Provide a research plan using validated implementation research frameworks or hybrid design research;</li><li>Have an appropriate strategy for measuring implementation research outcomes and real-world effectiveness outcomes and indicators. Other health or non-health outcome measures, especially those identified as important by patient participants and/or critical for advancing Universal Health Coverage (UHC)<sup>[8]</sup>, are also welcome;</li><li>Specifically address health equity and the principles of UHC;</li><li>Engage an appropriately expert and skilled research team which can ensure a suitable multidisciplinary approach and that demonstrates equitable partnership and shared leadership between HIC-LMIC, and/or non-Indigenous-Indigenous members of the project team and external stakeholders through a clear governance strategy;</li><li>Provide a stakeholder engagement strategy with evidence of support/engagement from key stakeholders for delivering patient-centred care;</li><li>Ensure that project partners are engaged from the beginning to contribute to the sustainability of the intervention after the end of project. Proposals should demonstrate sustainability of the strategy, beyond the lifespan of the project;</li><li>Provide opportunities for implementation research capacity building for early career researchers and team members from lower resourced environments, such as LMICs or disadvantaged communities;</li><li>Ensure meaningful involvement of early career team members, including at least one early career member as a co-investigator.</li> </ul><p>The study population may include the general population, people with one or more existing NCDs, those currently without NCDs, or a combination of both. The study population may also include patients with NCDs and chronic infectious disease(s) (e.g., studies that focus on integrating NCD management into an HIV or tuberculosis clinic). With regard to NCDs, applicants are encouraged to explore any chronic non-communicable condition (or combination of conditions), including mental health disorders, neurological disorders and sleep disorders.</p><p>Proposals are expected to use an appropriate implementation research design and frameworks for feasibility studies, cluster randomised control trials (cRCTs), before and after studies, and additional implementation science classifications of study designs (e.g. hybrid designs)<sup>[9]</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>[10]</sup>.</p><p>Applicants are not limited to use any particular design, however a validated implementation research framework should underpin the study.</p><p>Proposals would be expected to generate evidence that is of direct relevance to policymakers, communities and practitioners. Also, proposals will require a strategy to include the relevant policymakers, local authorities, as well as other stakeholders such as community groups, or other individuals or organisations involved in the implementation of the intervention, with co-creation from the development of the project through to the implementation knowledge translation phase. Applicants should also provide a clear plan for continuing to engage with stakeholders.</p><p>Stakeholders also include patients, their family members and carers. Their contributions should be nurtured through meaningful engagement from the outset, not only as participants in the research undertaken. Patient engagement throughout the research project is critical to developing patient-centred models of care.</p><p>All stakeholders should be engaged at every stage of the research project, from initial ideation of research questions, throughout the duration of the project, and afterwards during the knowledge translation phase. It is also important to include stakeholders who can help sustain the project’s implementation, facilitate scale up, and use the knowledge generated from the project after the grant ends.</p><p>Poverty, racism, gender inequality, ethnic discrimination, and other inequities are directly associated with reduced potential for equitable access to quality care. Proposals should consider the social determinants of health and discuss their potential impact on the effective implementation of the intervention(s). If there is a focus on a particular population (e.g., gender, race and/or ethnicity), then the reason for this should be justified.</p><p>In order to promote health equity, proposals should aim to address differences in intervention access, uptake, and effectiveness in socially disadvantaged groups and develop strategies for reducing inequities. To facilitate this process at the data analysis stage, studies should be designed to address such differences. At a minimum, studies should capture and disaggregate data on sex and/or gender differences. If feasible, a plan for capturing intersectional impacts on health outcomes should be included in the analysis strategy.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, including internationally, as appropriate. These activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the Annual Scientific Meetings of the GACD, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for such activities and may consider covering the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.</p><p>Applicants envisaging to include clinical studies<sup>[11]</sup> should provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] As defined by the World Bank.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <a href=\"https://www.gacd.org\">https://www.gacd.org</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] Kruk ME, Pate M, Mullan Z.

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The topic encompasses actions within the scope of the co-programmed European Partnership on Globally Competitive Space Systems (‘Space Partnership’) in the areas of satellite communication (SatCom), Earth Observation (EO) and New Commercial Space Transportation Solutions and is part of cohesive activities in the domain of digital developments under the grand heading of “digitalisation for commercial space solutions”.</p><p>Under the area of <em>Access to Space</em> related to New Space Transportation Solutions, this topic focusses on the Low to Mid TRL level building blocks for key technologies required to strengthen competitiveness in this domain. Areas for launch service improvement are e.g., health monitoring systems, enabling real time subsystem monitoring through all mission phases, high speed sensor networks for on board real-time data feeds, smart avionics, functional building blocks for autonomy, enhanced ground-board high-data rate communication and high-speed on-board computer, as well as Artificial Intelligence algorithms to process high volumes of data.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to one or several of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Improved space transportation systems and launcher sustainability, reduced costs and operational constraints as well as enhanced system monitoring and autonomy;</li><li>Technology developments for New Space Transportation Solutions, including addressing software and digital tools;</li><li>Models for mission, system design and optimisation, able to integrate life cycle analysis, engineering and environmental models for optimisation of development through manufacturing and mission implementation.</li> </ul><p>This will contribute to developing, deploying global space-based services applications and data and contribute to fostering the EU's space sector competitiveness, as stated in the expected impact of this destination.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>To tackle the above-mentioned expected outcomes, the following R&amp;I is expected to be addressed:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>the maturation of eco-design software tools enhancing reconfigurability in orbit</li><li>the maturation of disruptive/game changing technologies related to digitalisation</li> </ul><p>Proposals are expected to promote cooperation between different actors (industry, SMEs and research institutions) and consider opportunities to quickly turn technological innovation into commercial use in space.</p><p>Proposals under this topic should explore synergies and be complementary to already funded actions in the context of technology development at component level. In particular, it is expected that projects make use of existing European technologies and/or building blocks at component level contributing to European non-dependence and strengthen competitiveness, and this should be clearly presented in the proposal. Furthermore, proposed activities should be complementary to H2020 and Horizon Europe funded projects, national activities and activities funded by the European Space Agency (ESA).</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Globally Competitive Space Systems’ (GCSS). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Globally Competitive Space Systems’ (GCSS) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. </p><p>In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.</p>"

However, in order to best exploit quantum sensors, it is critical to prepare the scientific community to use the data generated by such sensors, develop new or tailor existing processing algorithms, and initiate and develop new applications based on this enhanced data.</p><p>The objective of this call is to prepare the grounds for the exploitation of Quantum Space Gravimetry mission data and foster the cooperation between the EU and Japan scientific communities on the topic. Effective QSG data exploitation requires research and dissemination activities to demonstrate the benefits of space-borne gravity field data and involve the relevant user institutions at early stage. To achieve this objective, one proposal will be selected. The proposal will identify Earth science fields relying on space gravity data exploitation and of mutual EU-Japan interest and will propose innovative algorithmic solutions highlighting the benefits of quantum space gravimetry. The proposal will discuss the expected QSG mission performance.</p><p>Horizon Europe will fund EU scientists only. Japan scientists will fund their own activities, expected to be at the same level as the EU contribution.</p><p>In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Reinforcing EU strategic autonomy by reducing non-EU dependencies on critical space equipment and related technologies across their entire supply chain;</li><li>Providing unrestricted access to critical space equipment and related technologies relevant for EU space missions;</li><li>Developing or regaining capacity to operate independently in space by developing resilient critical space equipment and related technologies supply chains, relying on EU supply chains and/or trustable and reliable supply chains not affected by non-EU export restrictions;</li><li>Enhancing competitiveness by developing products and capabilities reaching equivalent or superior performance level than those from outside the EU and compete at worldwide level;</li><li>Opening new opportunities for manufacturers by reducing dependency on non-EU export restricted technologies.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Unrestricted access to state-of-art space equipment and related technologies is a pre-requisite for the EU space industry responding to EU space missions. However, especially for some families of equipment, the available solutions in EU do not meet the current high-performance space requirements and alternative products, sourced from outside EU, are either affected by non-EU export control with extra territorial applicability, that limit the access, re-export or raise challenges in terms of trustable supply chains for the implementation of EU space missions with a security dimension.</p><p>Within the frame of this topic it is expected to finance and implement development projects aiming at maturing critical space equipment with the final goal of lowering the dependency from outside EU, establish a long-term sustainable supply chain and support EU strategic autonomy in the space sector. The selection of the supply chains shall reflect this objective. Therefore, the supply chain shall preferably be built fully based in EU and when this can only be achieved partially (i.e. because of lack of current EU capabilities that cannot be developed within the project), services procured from outside EU shall nevertheless ensure that the overall supply chain will remain trustable and not affected by non-EU export control. The latest scenario is subject to the approval of the granting authority.</p><p>Below, the list of space equipment and related technologies relevant for this Call. It has been identified based on needs related to strategic institutional programs, inputs from relevant European stakeholders and the EU Observatory of Critical Technologies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Chip Scale Atomic Clocks [Target final TRL 6]</li><li>Solar Cells [Target final TRL 5-6]</li> </ul><p>Additional, context information and technical requirements are provided in the Technical Requirements Guidance document published on the Funding &amp; Tenders Portal outlining all relevant information for each of the above-mentioned development lines.</p><p>A proposal should address only one technology area and clearly identify the area being addressed.</p><p>Space is a low volume market affected by a dynamic industrial landscape compared to the terrestrial market therefore, technological spin in and/or bilateral collaborations should be enhanced between European non-space and space industries. Furthermore, proposed activities should be complementary to relevant national and/or other activities at European level. Complementary activities should be clearly identified, described and the proposal should report how the complementarity is ensured.</p><p>To achieve the non-dependence objective, applicants must include a dedicated proposal’s paragraph covering:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The description of the technology and high-level breakdown of the space equipment supply chain to be used. Applicants should demonstrate that the supply chain and final product are free of any legal export restrictions or limitations, such as those established in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or equivalent instruments applicable in other non-EU jurisdictions. Applicants shall also report, in a dedicated subsection, if and which part of the supply chain is affected by non-EU export controls such as the Export Administration regulation (EAR).</li><li>The description of the suitable technology development process that has been identified and set up within the consortium for avoiding export restrictions of non-EU states and assess vulnerabilities of the supply chain.</li> </ul><p>Proposal covering space equipment and related technology developments that are targeting a final TRL equal or higher than 5, shall include a list of proposed applicable standards (e.g. ECSS, ESCC, MIL, JEDEC, …) that are considered relevant for implementing a formal space evaluation and/or qualification.</p><p>The proposal must include specific tasks as part of the work plan and related dedicated confidential deliverables to be provided within 6 months from the start of the project to the relevant Commission DG and Executive Agency (i.e. DG-DEFIS and HaDEA), with the objective of:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Analysing and describing, <strong>in detail,</strong> the full supply chain, each entity and its role in the supply chain, level of criticality and, if relevant, identify dependencies from outside EU;</li><li>Describe the industrial technical roadmap and a business plan for commercialization with accurate understanding of applications needs, space mission insertion, including time to market indication, of the developed product.</li><li>Reporting the list of relevant non-EU export control with extra territorial applicability for the specific technology/product under development, independently from the supply chain established for the EU-COM project.</li><li>Undertaking a comprehensive literature review of the relevant technology/product reporting the state-of-the-art and highlighting potential gaps between current EU solutions and competition from outside EU.</li> </ol><p>Unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority before the grant agreement is signed, beneficiaries must ensure that none of the entities that participate as affiliated entities, associated partners or subcontractors are established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions.</p><p>It is recalled to the applicants that all provisions reported by the Model Grant Agreements, related to topics with restricted eligibility conditions, are applied. Under this light, for example the consortiums shall ensure that for a period up to 4 years after the end of the action, supply and availability of the products and/or processes developed and/or qualified within the project (consortium as whole or individual beneficiaries) shall be given to any entity in EU, at fair and reasonable market prices, conditions and with no legal restrictions and limitations stemming for example from International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), or equivalent instruments applicable in non-EU jurisdictions. Additionally, beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally notify the granting authority before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and the granting authority may up to four years after the end of the action object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results.</p><p>In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not relevant.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Reinforcing EU strategic autonomy by reducing non-EU dependencies on critical space EEE components and related technologies across their entire supply chain;</li><li>Providing unrestricted access to critical space EEE components and related technologies relevant for EU space missions;</li><li>Developing or regaining capacity to operate independently in space by developing resilient space EEE components and related technologies supply chains, relying on EU supply chains and/or trustable and reliable supply chains not affected by non-EU export restrictions;</li><li>Enhancing competitiveness by developing products and capabilities reaching equivalent or superior performance level than those from outside the EU and compete at worldwide level;</li><li>Opening new opportunities for manufacturers by reducing dependency on non-EU export restricted technologies.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Unrestricted access to state-of-art space EEE components and related technologies is a pre-requisite for the EU space industry responding to EU space missions. However, especially for some families of components, the available solutions in EU do not meet the current high-performance space requirements. Currently, alternative products sourced from outside EU, are either affected by non-EU export control, that limits its use, or present challenges in terms of trustable supply chains for the implementation of EU space missions with a security dimension.</p><p>Within the frame of this topic, it is expected to finance and implement development projects aiming at maturing critical space EEE components with the final goal of lowering the dependency from outside EU. This will be done by establishing a long-term sustainable supply chain for supporting EU strategic autonomy in the space sector. The selection of the supply chains shall reflect this objective. Therefore, the supply chain shall preferably be built fully based in EU and when this can only be achieved partially (i.e. because of lack of current EU capabilities for unrestricted advanced semiconductor processes or advanced materials that cannot be developed within the project), services procured from outside EU shall nevertheless ensure that the overall supply chain will remain trustable and not affected by non-EU export control. The latest scenario is subject to the approval of the granting authority.</p><p>Below, the list of space EEE components and related technologies relevant for this Call. It has been identified based on needs related to strategic institutional space programs, inputs from European stakeholders and the EU Observatory of Critical Technologies:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Advanced packages – Organic substrate for very high, fine pitch [Target final TRL 6-7]</li><li>MRAM Memories [Target final TRL 7]</li> </ul><p>Additional context information and technical requirements are provided in the Technical Requirements Guidance document published on the Funding &amp; Tenders Portal outlining all relevant information for each of the above-mentioned development lines.</p><p>A proposal should address only one technology area and clearly identify the area being addressed.</p><p>Space is a low volume market affected by a dynamic industrial landscape compared to the terrestrial market therefore, technological spin in and/or bilateral collaborations should be enhanced between European non-space and space industries. Furthermore, proposed activities should be complementary to relevant national and/or other activities at European level. Complementary activities should be clearly identified, described and the proposal should report how the complementarity is ensured.</p><p>To achieve the non-dependence objective, applicants are expected to include a dedicated proposal’s paragraph covering:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The description of the technology and/or technology processes and high-level breakdown of the space EEE component supply chain to be used. Applicants should demonstrate that the supply chain and final product are free of any legal export restrictions or limitations, such as those established in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or equivalent instruments applicable in other non-EU jurisdictions. Applicants shall also report, in a dedicated subsection, if and which part of the supply chain is affected by non-EU export controls such as the Export Administration regulation (EAR) i.e. EAR99.</li><li>The description of the suitable technology development process that has been identified and set up within the consortium for avoiding export restrictions of non-EU states and assess vulnerabilities of the supply chain.</li> </ul><p>Proposal covering space EEE components and related technology developments that are targeting a final TRL equal or higher than 5, shall include a list of proposed applicable standards (e.g. EN, ECSS, ESCC, MIL, JEDEC,…) that are considered relevant for implementing a formal space evaluation and/or qualification. Additionally, projects that aim at a formal space qualification shall deliver the full data pack planned to be submitted to the qualification authority. This deliverable shall me marked sensitive and it shall be shared with the granting authority (i.e. DG-DEFIS and HaDEA). Products that will successfully complete the space evaluation/qualification either within the EU-COM activity or, as a consecutive follow up, shall inform DG-DEFIS and engrave on the package (if present) the EU flag.</p><p>The proposal must include specific tasks as part of the work plan and related dedicated confidential deliverables to be provided within 6 months from the start of the project to the relevant Commission DG and Executive Agency (i.e. DG-DEFIS and HaDEA), with the objective of:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Analysing and describing, <strong>in detail</strong>, the full supply chain, each entity and its role in the supply chain, level of criticality and, if relevant, identify dependencies from outside EU;</li><li>Describing the industrial technical roadmap and a business plan for commercialization with accurate understanding of applications needs, space mission insertion, including time to market indication, of the developed product.</li><li>Reporting the list of relevant non-EU export control with extra territorial applicability for the specific technology/product under development, independently from the supply chain established for the EU-COM project.</li><li>Undertaking a comprehensive literature review of the relevant technology/product reporting the state-of-the-art and highlighting potential gaps between current EU solutions and competition from outside EU.</li> </ul><p>Unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority before the grant agreement, beneficiaries must ensure that none of the entities that participate as affiliated entities, associated partners or subcontractors are established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions.</p><p>It is recalled to the applicants that all provisions reported by the Model Grant Agreements, related to topics with restricted eligibility conditions, are applied. For example, under this light, the consortiums shall ensure that for a period up to 4 years after the end of the action, supply and availability of the products and/or processes developed and/or qualified within the project (consortium as whole or individual beneficiaries) shall be given to any entity in EU, at fair and reasonable market prices, conditions and with no legal restrictions and limitations stemming for example from International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), or equivalent instruments applicable in non-EU jurisdictions. Additionally, beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally notify the granting authority (i.e. DG-DEFIS and HaDEA) before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and the granting authority may up to four years after the end of the action object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results.</p><p>In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not relevant.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The topic encompasses actions within the scope of the co-programmed European Partnership on Globally Competitive Space Systems (‘Space Partnership’) in the areas of satellite communication (SatCom), Earth Observation (EO) and New Commercial Space Transportation Solutions and is part of cohesive activities in the domain of digital developments under the grand heading of “digitalisation for commercial space solutions”.</p><p>Under the area of <em>Access to Space</em> related to New Space Transportation Solutions, this topic focusses on the Mid to High TRL level developments of key technologies required to strengthen competitiveness in this domain.</p><p>Cost reduction, enhanced availability, and improved reliability must be reached by harnessing the advantages of reusability and modularity. Areas for launch service improvement are e.g., health monitoring systems, enabling real time subsystem monitoring through all mission phases, development of technologies and functional building blocks with a focus on digital solutions for autonomy, development of low cost/low mass sensors and efficient avionics. The demand for readily accessible off-the-shelf modular solutions and products, caters to the needs of all launcher manufacturers.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to one or several of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The ability to identify and locate structural damage remotely (like cracks, corrosion, delamination or structural weakening) within the transportation systems before it leads to significant failure.</li><li>The ability to provide autonomous thermo-mechanical monitoring enabling tracking changes in temperature, mechanical behaviour and loads experienced by the transportation systems, to predict and autonomous prevent failures.</li> </ul><p>This will contribute to developing, deploying global space-based services applications and data and contribute to fostering the EU's space sector competitiveness, as stated in the expected impact of this destination.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>To tackle the above-mentioned expected outcomes, the following R&amp;I should be addressed: R&amp;I on advanced technologies and digital sensors for new space transportation, such as smart avionics with modularity and reusability drivers, health monitoring system and smart sensors, and structural health monitoring addressing thermo-mechanical monitoring and damage detection, ground and flight software for data management even by use of AI-algorithms.</p><p>The developments should aim at on-ground or in-orbit demonstration focusing on software and digital tools.</p><p>Proposals are expected to promote cooperation between different actors (industry, SMEs and research institutions) and consider opportunities to quickly turn technological innovation into commercial use in space via e.g., on-ground or in orbit demonstration.</p><p>Proposals under this topic should explore synergies and be complementary to already funded actions in the context of technology development at component level. In particular, it is expected that projects make use of existing European technologies and/or building blocks at component level contributing to European non-dependence and strengthen competitiveness, and this should be clearly presented in the proposal. Furthermore, proposed activities should be complementary to H2020 and Horizon Europe funded projects, national activities and activities funded by the European Space Agency (ESA).</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Globally Competitive Space Systems’ (GCSS). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Globally Competitive Space Systems’ (GCSS) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. </p><p>This topic contributes to the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) and addresses Space technologies falling under the sectors of “digital technologies” and “deep tech innovation”. This topic addresses objectives stated in the STEP Regulation, e.g., the development of critical technologies and safeguarding and strengthening their EU value chain. This topic will help reduce strategic dependencies from outside of the EU for components and equipment for the EU Space Programme, as well as for other European space applications.</p><p>In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Social Circular Enterprises (SCEs)<sup>[1]</sup> need to adapt to new market realities in the circular economy, driven by the search for new market opportunities (e.g. secondary raw materials market, business models addressing change in consumption awareness, and technological developments improving productivity). To achieve this adaptation, investment in R&amp;D capacity and technology for SCEs is essential. Besides further developing its offer towards consumers, SCEs are increasingly focussing their activities towards B2B markets, such as for secondary raw materials. In that regard, SCEs started to explore the growing and labour-intensive market of sorting, recycling and upcycling services for other businesses. Research and innovation can accelerate this potential and is most needed in the area to remain competitive. Moreover, research and innovation in this sector can lever potentials beyond productivity and competitiveness, as SCEs pursue a triple impact: economic, green (contribute to a circular and resource efficient economy) and social (employment of vulnerable groups).</p><p>The following outcomes are expected for SCEs and wider circular networks:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Improve the uptake and scale of technology solutions in individual SCE and promote shared technology development and engineering through SCE clusters.</li><li>Improve competitiveness through enhanced productivity, as well as new market opportunities, for SCEs related to specific waste streams with potential for competitive advantages, such as, textiles, WEEE (waste electrical and electronic equipment) and construction materials;</li><li>Prove technical, economic, and environmental excellence of SCE in (local) circular value chains (e.g. I-US) leading to increased collaboration with (mainstream / for profit) industrial partners;</li><li>Contribute to the reduction of non-recyclable waste generated in the region/area of the cluster by contributing to the re-using and transforming waste, by-products, and side-streams into new/secondary resources of raw materials;</li><li>Increase employment of persons with a distance to the labour market in SCE and improve their labour productivity, for example by using assistive technology in the work process and use of data (e.g. AI trained assessment and instructions).</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Social Circular Enterprises (SCEs) have been pioneers in the circular economy since decades. They are active in all stages of the circular economy and deal with various waste stream. SCEs are also known to offer new and innovative circular business models and brining new circular services and products to the market. In the last decade SCE also entered the market of secondary raw materials by collecting and dissembling various products and goods. The majority of SCEs are SMEs and offer local employment opportunities to vulnerable groups (99%)<sup>[2]</sup>. On average, a circular social enterprise creates 70 jobs per 1,000 tons collected with a view of being re-used.</p><p>Projects are expected to research and develop a replicable tech-oriented demonstrator(s) within social circular clusters. Within a demonstrator, partners are expected to jointly adapt, design, test and implement relevant technology solutions. The following specific activities are expected within demonstrators:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The demonstrators are supposed to organise as a Social Circular Tech Cluster allowing to pool resources and adapt, develop and test technology solutions. This will facilitate more business opportunities (tech based spin-offs) and sharing of expertise with relevant industries.</li><li>A demonstrator consortium should be active in at least two Member States or Associated Countries and can choose to focus on textile and construction waste or WEEE. Each demonstrator consortium exists out of two or more clusters, each grouping individual SCEs (ideally with different degrees of maturity<sup>[3]</sup>), for-profit circular companies (e.g. sectoral peers in secondary raw materials industries), research, and tech centres able to support SCE with relevant technology and research capacity. SCEs should form the core of the consortia, and should benefit directly from the interventions to improve their triple impact model. Public authorities and SCE federations could engage where appropriate. Demonstrator consortia should to be transnational in order to compare pilots in different markets.</li><li>Adapting, designing and developing technologies in SCEs needs should focus on optimising efficiency<sup>[4]</sup> in management and processing of waste streams and enlarge the potential market activity of SCEs in the circular economy (WEEE, textiles and construction focus). Relevant technologies should improve the productivity and innovation capacity within SCE and consequently the market position in the secondary raw materials markets. Technologies can include data driven technologies such as AI to improve sorting knowledge and decision making (screening based on automated recognition with cost-benefit analysis), software to standardise repair operations and instructions, improve stocks management and increase reuse sales by optimising the pricing system (e.g. automated value calculation of incoming materials and goods), digital modelling tools (including material passport), etc.</li><li>Research could also include the potential of assistive technologies to support employees (mostly persons with disabilities, specific impairments, or social disadvantages) in SCE in order to improve their productivity and wellbeing.</li><li>Market research focussing on improving the position of SCE as an attractive partner in management and processing of waste streams (in terms of textile, WEEE and construction materials) with most potential for growth in B2B markets. For example focussing on collection, disassembly, sorting, purification, concentration, recycling, exchanging or preparation, for the valorisation of waste to be used as feedstock for other plants and companies across sectors and/or across value chains. This market research can include specific sectoral assessment of economic potential for most labour-intensive circular activities.</li><li>By organising through clusters, demonstrators are motivated to develop shared engineering activities (labs, strategies and shared technology) to make technology accessible for enterprises with less capacity and resources and to reduce overall costs for individual SCEs.</li><li>Where relevant, proposals are encouraged to build on, or seek collaboration with, existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives and funding programmes. In particular, the project could build further on relevant knowledge, tools, methods and technology developed and applied within existing H4C (Clusters for Circularity) and its knowledge platform.<sup>[5]</sup></li> </ul><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://circulareconomy.europa.eu/platform/sites/default/files/social_circular_economy_2017.pdf\">https://circulareconomy.europa.eu/platform/sites/default/files/social_circular_economy_2017.pdf</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>Proximity and social economy industrial ecosystem.

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The strategic objective of this topic is to develop capabilities to ‘Act in Space’ through demonstrating in space a pilot mission by 2030 related to ISOS. The envisaged ISOS pilot mission shall provide the necessary seed components for a future service infrastructure, available to the European in-space ecosystem (including the EU assets), driving the generation of a new in-space economy, providing enhanced in-orbit technology demonstration and maximising EU technology non-dependence.</p><p>This pilot mission will largely contribute to ensure EU’s freedom of action in space, increase the resilience and protection of EU assets in space and foster the development of the new in-space economy. A pioneering and a novel mission concept, which is unique compared to other initiatives among all space-faring nations is envisaged. The mission will build on previous R&amp;I with an operational mission concept, focusing on application and service demonstration, with a concrete view to commercial and governmental usage. The detailed mission concept will be derived in close coordination with EU Member States and EEA countries through a dedicated ISOS Pilot Mission Advisory Group (PMAG)<sup>161</sup>.</p><p>This topic addresses the detailed design of the <strong>satAPPs component of the ISOS pilot mission</strong><em>,</em> that allows the creation of composable and exchangeable functional modules for satellite upgrade and the development of a European catalogue of satAPPs, following the AppStore approach and fostering system modularisation and flexibility.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>A sustainable, highly automated, flexible and economically viable space infrastructure, building on technologies and concepts for a circular economy in space, e.g. plug-and-play spacecraft functionality introducing recycling/re-use of spacecraft modules/functionalities;</li><li>ISOS Pilot mission preparation up to detailed mission and system design for the satAPPs component, and maturation of enabling technologies and innovative system and operational concepts;</li><li>Elaboration of interfaces between the different components of the mission, together with the other mission components (i.e. servicing, HOST and logistics) and the ISOS Pilot Mission Coordination and Support Action (CSA)<sup>162</sup>;</li><li>Enhancing opportunities for IOD/V through satAPPs by actively promoting experiment plug and play on the HOST and prepared assets;</li><li>Contribution to the ISOS Pilot Mission Objectives provided in the technical annex<sup>163</sup>;</li><li>Elaboration of clear use cases and relevant business models focussing on governmental and/or commercial needs;</li><li>Contributing to a European catalogue of satAPPs, following the AppStore approach and fostering system modularisation and flexibility;</li><li>Ensuring the availability of results to the next mission phases.</li> </ul><p>This topic will contribute to, in the medium to long term, developing, deploying global space-based services and contribute to fostering the European space sector competitiveness, as stated in the expected impact of this destination.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>To tackle the above expected outcomes, the following R&amp;I actions should be addressed, taking into account the provided technical annex<sup>163</sup>:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>R&amp;I to complete ISOS Pilot mission detailed mission and system design<sup>164</sup> (including relevant key technology maturation) for the satAPPs component. All relevant technologies shall reach the necessary TRL.</li><li>R&amp;I on technologies relevant for innovative satAPPs at TRL 6 that will be used in the context of the ISOS pilot mission to demonstrate upgrade of components’ functionalities and/or payload exchange and IOD/V experiments.</li><li>R&amp;I on satAPP modules specifically for hosting IOD/V experiments.</li><li>Contribution to the overall ISOS pilot mission detail design in close cooperation with other mission components, the ISOS Pilot Mission Coordination and Support Action and the ISOS Pilot Mission Advisory Group. </li> </ul><p>Proposals are expected to promote cooperation between different actors (industry, SMEs and research institutions) and consider opportunities to quickly turn technological innovation into commercial use in space via e.g., on-ground or in-orbit demonstration.</p><p>Proposals should clearly present a concrete plan to ensure that required technologies reach the necessary TRL at the end of the project. Moreover, complementarities with previous and/or ongoing R&amp;I for the proposed servicing component must be clearly described. More specifically, proposals should explore relevant and promising solutions developed in Horizon Europe, Horizon 2020, or other EU-funded relevant activities, in particular, the topics: Future Space Ecosystem (HORIZON-CL4-2021-SPACE-01-12/ 2022-SPACE-01-11/ 2023-SPACE-01-12), EIC Accelerator WP2025 “Innovative in-space servicing, operations, robotics and technologies for resilient EU space infrastructure” and in relevant projects funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) and/or national programmes. Finally, proposals are also expected to consider the use of existing European technologies and/or building blocks, including at component level, contributing to European non-dependence and strengthen competitiveness.</p><p>International cooperation is encouraged in this topic.</p><p>In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.</p><p>This topic contributes to the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) and addresses Space technologies falling under the sectors of “digital technologies” and “deep tech innovation”. This topic addresses objectives stated in the STEP Regulation, e.g., the development of critical technologies and safeguarding and strengthening their EU value chain. This topic will help reduce strategic dependencies from outside of the EU for components and equipment for the EU Space Programme, as well as for other European space applications.</p><p>The project(s) selected from this topic are expected to collaborate among themselves and with those selected under topics HORIZON-CL4-2025-02-SPACE-21, 22, 23 and ISOS Pilot Mission Coordination and Support Action, in order to ensure interoperability and the necessary and sufficient documentation and information sharing for the implementation of the Pilot Mission, to make economies of scale in sharing best practices, defining common processes for addressing the different challenges, ensuring efficient monitoring and review, organising dissemination and communication activities, etc. Such collaboration among all those projects will be formalised by a collaboration agreement.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination “Ensuring equal access to innovative, sustainable, and high-quality healthcare”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results directed towards and contributing to all the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Healthcare professionals, at all stages of healthcare provision, have access to user-centric, robust and trustworthy virtual assistant solutions based on Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)<sup>[1]</sup> models and other AI tools to support them towards the provision of safer, more efficient and personalised care.</li><li>Healthcare professionals benefit from cross-country applicable methodologies with the aim to facilitate acceptability, healthcare uptake and public trust of virtual assistant tools based on Generative AI models.</li><li>Patients benefit from enhanced outcomes, more personalised care, and increased engagement with their healthcare professionals, leading to improved safety, quality of care, access to appropriate healthcare information and patient-doctor communication.</li><li>Healthcare systems benefit from improved cost-effective patient outcomes, superior to standard of care in terms of accuracy, safety, and quality, and from cost-savings through advancements in highly accurate, transparent, traceable, and explainable solutions.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Healthcare professionals face important challenges related to efficiency, patient safety and provision of quality care with limited health systems’ resources. Multimodality of health data combined with the available high-performance computing capabilities have the potential to empower effective and accurate use of trustworthy and ethical Generative AI-based solutions, augmented by other AI tools to address these challenges. Generative AI may benefit patients, healthcare professionals and health systems.</p><p>This topic will contribute to advancing and generating research to better understand and improve Generative AI-based virtual assistant solutions and their applicability in healthcare settings by improving patient health outcomes, fostering personalised healthcare and support the resilience, sustainability, and efficiency of the healthcare systems. In addition, the topic aims to also cover the understanding and mitigation of possible shortcomings (biases) and frameworks for monitoring and overseeing these solutions’ use.</p><p>Research actions under this topic should include all the following activities, ensuring multidisciplinary approaches and a broad representation of stakeholders in the consortia (e.g. industry, academia, healthcare professionals, patients):</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop virtual assistant solutions based on new or optimised trustworthy and ethical Generative AI models, augmented by other AI tools to support healthcare professionals. The models should leverage extensive and diverse multimodal health and research data, public knowledge, and reliable healthcare systems information relevant for healthcare settings. Examples can include electronic health records, medical imaging, genomics, proteomics, molecular data, laboratory results, patient information (including on safety), and/or unstructured health data (the applicants may choose any type of available large-scale data). The development and training of the models should take place in multinational consortia and federated governance approaches should be considered. The applicants should demonstrate how the project goes beyond combining existing data and generates new specific knowledge to improve clinical decision making.</li><li>Demonstrate the added-value and clinical utility of the virtual assistant solutions in at least two healthcare use cases in different medical fields and unmet needs showing e.g. improved care management and efficiency, prediction of potential patient-specific therapeutic strategies and outcomes, etc. The applicants should provide evidence of high maturity technology for the use cases and assess the relative effectiveness of the solutions compared with standard of care, including on why these solutions would be superior to other AI tools and would deliver better outcomes. They should actively engage healthcare professionals as end users, and other stakeholders such as patients, caregivers in the development and testing of the solutions, ensuring that diverse perspectives and intersectional considerations are integrated throughout the process. Training and education activities for healthcare professionals should be organised.</li><li>Develop a regulatory strategy/interaction plan with regulators (including in the area of Health Technology Assessment) for generating evidence, where relevant, in a timely manner. Consider also the potential for future regulatory impact of the results and sustainability aspects.</li><li>Develop or adapt existing methodologies for continuous assessment of the developed solutions. The methodologies should demonstrate technical robustness, healthcare utility and trustworthiness of the Generative AI-based solutions, by adopting:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Appropriate metrics for evaluating alignment with human values, ethical principles and the intended purposes of Generative AI models, performance including testing their technical robustness and clinical utility, as well as their model intelligibility, in view of ensuring AI trustworthiness<sup>[2]</sup>.</li><li>Appropriate solutions to identify and mitigate potential bias<sup>[3]</sup> of the models (e.g. representativeness of the data, bias of the trainer, bias of training and validation data, algorithmic discrimination and bias including gender bias etc.).</li><li>Appropriate techniques to discover and demonstrate explainability of model reasoning, increase users’ trust, and address the black box element, thus further enhancing transparency, model explainability and alignment.</li><li>Methods to systematically address and assess ELSI (Ethical, Legal and Societal Implications), including data privacy concerns and risk of discrimination/bias (not limited to sex, gender, age, disability, race or ethnicity, religion, belief, minority and/or vulnerable groups). The implication of medical errors originated from AI-assisted decision-making and the effects on potential legal liability for healthcare professionals should be explored.</li>   </ul> </li> </ul><p>All proposals should demonstrate EU added value by focusing on the development and/or use of trustworthy Generative AI models developed in the EU and Associated countries, involving in the consortium EU industrial developers, including leading-edge startups when possible. An open-source approach is encouraged when technically and economically feasible. Successful proposals are encouraged to utilise the resources offered by the AI factories<sup>[4]</sup>, when relevant and in accordance with the specific access terms and conditions.</p><p>The proposals should adhere to the FAIR<sup>[5]</sup> data principles and apply GDPR<sup>[6]</sup> compliant processes for personal data protection based on good practices of the European research infrastructures, where relevant. The proposals should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness of models, as much as possible going well beyond documentation and extending to aspects such as assumptions, code and FAIR data management.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to exploit potential synergies with the projects funded under the topic HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-24, as well as with other projects funded under Horizon Europe and Digital Europe Programmes. When the use cases are relevant to diseases covered by specific Horizon Europe Partnerships or missions (e.g., European Partnership on Rare Diseases, European Partnership on transforming health and care systems, the Cancer Mission, etc.), the proposals should adopt the federated data-management and data access recommendations already developed. Moreover, the applicants are encouraged to leverage available and emerging data infrastructures (e.g., European Health Data Space<sup>[7]</sup>, European Genomic Data Infrastructure<sup>[8]</sup>, Cancer Image Europe<sup>[9]</sup>, European Open Science Cloud<sup>[10]</sup>, EBRAINS<sup>[11]</sup> etc.), whenever relevant. Adopting EOSC recommendations and services for high-quality software is also encouraged. The expansion of health data and/or existing or under development AI infrastructures is not in the scope of this topic.</p><p>When possible, the developed models should be trained with multimodal data in different EU languages, to ensure accessibility and inclusivity.</p><p>Successful proposals are encouraged to utilise the resources offered by the AI factories<sup>[4]</sup>, when relevant and in accordance with the specific access terms and conditions.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts and institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. The active engagement of healthcare professionals as end users, patients, and their caregivers is central to achieving targeted outcomes in the development and testing of the Generative AI virtual assistant solutions.</p><p>Proposals should consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) based on its experience and with respect to the value it could bring in providing an effective interface between research activities and preliminary regulatory science as well as strategies and frameworks that address fit for regulatory requirements. In that respect, the JRC will consider collaborating with any successful proposal and this collaboration, when relevant, should be established after the proposal’s approval.</p><p>All proposals selected for funding under this topic are strongly encouraged to collaborate, for example by participating in networking and joint activities, exchange of knowledge, developing and adopting best practices, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget covering the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.</p><p>Applicants envisaging to include clinical studies<sup>[13]</sup> should provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] Generative AI is a type of AI technology that can generate various forms of new content such as text, images, sounds, and even code, such as for programming or gene sequencing (<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/redirection/document/101621\">https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/redirection/document/101621</a>).</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, published by the European Commission’s High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ai-alliance-consultation.1.html\">https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ai-alliance-consultation.1.html</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] Guidelines on the responsible use of generative AI in research developed by the European Research Area Forum: <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/guidelines-responsible-use-generative-ai-research-developed-european-research-area-forum-2024-03-20_en\">https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/guidelines-responsible-use-generative-ai-research-developed-european-research-area-forum-2024-03-20_en</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-factories\">https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-factories</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] See definition of FAIR data in the introduction to this work programme part.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] General Data Protection Regulation: <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection_en\">https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection_en</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] <a href=\"https://health.ec.europa.eu/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/european-health-data-space_en\">https://health.ec.europa.eu/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/european-health-data-space_en</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[8] <a href=\"https://gdi.onemilliongenomes.eu\">https://gdi.onemilliongenomes.eu</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[9] <a href=\"https://cancerimage.eu\">https://cancerimage.eu</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[10] <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-2020-2024/our-digital-future/open-science/european-open-science-cloud-eosc_en\">https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-2020-2024/our-digital-future/open-science/european-open-science-cloud-eosc_en</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[11] <a href=\"https://www.ebrains.eu/\">https://www.ebrains.eu</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[12] <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-factories\">https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-factories</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[13] Please note that the definition of clinical studies (see introduction to this work programme part) is broad and it is recommended that you review it thoroughly before submitting your application.</p>"

Currently, alternative products sourced from outside EU, are either affected by non-EU export control, that limits its use, or present challenges in terms of trustable supply chains for the implementation of EU space missions with a security dimension.</p><p>Within the frame of this topic, it is expected to finance and implement development projects aiming at maturing critical space EEE components with the final goal of lowering the dependency from outside EU. This will be done by establishing a long-term sustainable supply chain for supporting EU strategic autonomy in the space sector. The selection of the supply chains shall reflect this objective. Therefore, the supply chain shall preferably be built fully based in EU and when this can only be achieved partially (i.e. because of lack of current EU capabilities for unrestricted advanced semiconductor processes or advanced materials that cannot be developed within the project), services procured from outside EU shall nevertheless ensure that the overall supply chain will remain trustable and not affected by non-EU export control. The latest scenario is subject to the approval of the granting authority.</p><p>Below, the space EEE component and related technologies relevant for this Call. It has been identified based on needs related to strategic institutional space programs, inputs from European stakeholders and the EU Observatory of Critical Technologies:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Connectors [Target final TRL 5-6]</li> </ul><p>Additional context information and technical requirements are provided in the Technical Requirements Guidance document published on the Funding &amp; Tenders Portal.</p><p>Space is a low volume market affected by a dynamic industrial landscape compared to the terrestrial market therefore, technological spin in and/or bilateral collaborations should be enhanced between European non-space and space industries. Furthermore, proposed activities should be complementary to relevant national and/or other activities at European level. Complementary activities should be clearly identified, described and the proposal should report how the complementarity is ensured.</p><p>To achieve the non-dependence objective, applicants are expected to include a dedicated proposal’s paragraph covering:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The description of the technology and/or technology processes and high-level breakdown of the space EEE component supply chain to be used. Applicants should demonstrate that the supply chain and final product are free of any legal export restrictions or limitations, such as those established in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or equivalent instruments applicable in other non-EU jurisdictions. Applicants shall also report, in a dedicated subsection, if and which part of the supply chain is affected by non-EU export controls such as the Export Administration regulation (EAR) i.e. EAR99.</li><li>The description of the suitable technology development process that has been identified and set up within the consortium for avoiding export restrictions of non-EU states and assess vulnerabilities of the supply chain.</li> </ul><p>Proposal covering space EEE components and related technology developments that are targeting a final TRL equal or higher than 5, shall include a list of proposed applicable standards (e.g. EN, ECSS, ESCC, MIL, JEDEC,…) that are considered relevant for implementing a formal space evaluation and/or qualification. Additionally, projects that aim at a formal space qualification shall deliver the full data pack planned to be submitted to the qualification authority. This deliverable shall me marked sensitive and it shall be shared with the granting authority (i.e. DG-DEFIS and HaDEA). Products that will successfully complete the space evaluation/qualification either within the EU-COM activity or as a consecutive follow up shall inform DG-DEFIS and engrave on the package, or if relevant, die the EU flag.</p><p>The proposal must include specific tasks as part of the work plan and related dedicated confidential deliverables to be provided within 6 months from the start of the project to the relevant Commission DG and Executive Agency (i.e. DG-DEFIS and HaDEA), with the objective of:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Analysing and describing, <strong>in detail</strong>, the full supply chain, each entity and its role in the supply chain, level of criticality and, if relevant, identify dependencies from outside EU;</li><li>Describing the industrial technical roadmap and a business plan for commercialization with accurate understanding of applications needs, space mission insertion, including time to market indication, of the developed product.</li><li>Reporting the list of relevant non-EU export control with extra territorial applicability for the specific technology/product under development, independently from the supply chain established for the EU-COM project.</li><li>Undertaking a comprehensive literature review of the relevant technology/product reporting the state-of-the-art and highlighting potential gaps between current EU solutions and competition from outside EU.</li> </ul><p>Unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority before the grant agreement, beneficiaries must ensure that none of the entities that participate as affiliated entities, associated partners or subcontractors are established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions.</p><p>It is recalled to the applicants that all provisions reported by the Model Grant Agreements, related to topics with restricted eligibility conditions, are applied. For example, under this light, the consortiums shall ensure that for a period up to 4 years after the end of the action, supply and availability of the products and/or processes developed and/or qualified within the project (consortium as whole or individual beneficiaries) shall be given to any entity in EU, at fair and reasonable market prices, conditions and with no legal restrictions and limitations stemming for example from International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), or equivalent instruments applicable in non-EU jurisdictions. Additionally, beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally notify the granting authority (i.e. DG-DEFIS and HaDEA) before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and the granting authority may up to four years after the end of the action object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results.</p><p>In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not relevant.</p>"
